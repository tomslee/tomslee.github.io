Uber drivers' characteristics, reasons for driving with Uber, hours of work and driving schedules, earnings and job satisfaction are analysed, using both administrative and survey data. Uber drivers have diverse pathways to the job, with the objective to earn supplemental income most important in Australia. Total hours and timing of work differ substantially between drivers. Drivers express high satisfaction regarding job flexibility but lower satisfaction about pay. Hours worked and job satisfaction depend importantly on a driver's pathway to the job.},

  abstract = {Crowdsourced delivery and other sharing economy platforms attract freelance workers by offering them flexibility in scheduling their own work hours. Those platforms, however, have been criticized for the lack of protection they offer workers. Since workers are treated as independent contractors, they do not receive minimum wage and other protection measures under labor law. In this paper, we examine the integration of driver compensation guarantees in a platform's dynamic matching decisions. We study the problem of designing dynamic matching policies that guarantee a particular level of compensation for active workers over a time period, while maintaining work hour flexibility. We model three types of policies, that are either wage-based or utilization-based. We propose an MDP model to capture the dynamic and stochastic nature of the problem, then design a value function approximation algorithm to efficiently solve the large-scale MDP model. Extensive computational testing is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed solution methodology and the compensation guarantees, using synthetic and real-world datasets. Our findings suggest that the utilization policy results in the highest earning for drivers, though at the expense of longer empty miles from drivers' origins to the pickup locations of matched orders. On the other hand, the effective wage policy leads to shorter average distance to pickup, but slightly lower earning to drivers. Both policies result in only a slight decrease in platform profit as compared to the base case, and exhibit lower dispersion in the distribution of driver earning while active. In contrast, the nominal wage policy shows a comparable trend to the base-case policy in terms of average driver earnings, suggesting minimal benefits for drivers.},

As a ``steward of urban data and the public interest,'' the Urban Data Trust was expected to protect residents' privacy, establish responsible data sharing standards, and provide individuals with a share in the profits derived from the data gathered about them. This article proposes technoscientific/platform capitalism theories as a theoretical framework in the research on data governance. I situate the Urban Data Trust within a series of policy responses to the problem of extractive data practices.

  abstract = {Problem definition: New York City and Seattle recently enacted minimum earnings regulations for ride-hailing providers that are based on their utilization rates. The regulations are intended to deliver minimum earnings while preserving the flexibility of the independent contractor model of work. Academic/practical relevance: This kind of regulation has the potential to impact marketplace stability, which we define as the ability of platforms to keep wages bounded while maintaining the current flexible (free-entry) work model. Methodology: We build a theoretical model to study the marketplace implications of this kind of regulation and identify precise conditions under which a utilization-based minimum earnings rule causes marketplace instability. We then calibrate our model using publicly available data, showing the extent to which the law can (or cannot) increase earnings while preserving both worker flexibility and marketplace stability. Results: For reasonable ranges of supply and demand elasticity, the law's ability to increase earnings while maintaining the free-entry work model is quite limited, and even when earnings increases are achievable, they cause significant increases in driver idleness. Managerial implications: Given the law's potential to cause instability, affected ride-hailing companies may need to respond to the law by reducing driver flexibility to limit supply.

  abstract = {For-hire vehicle trips in the five boroughs of New York City from 2014 to 2017 increased by 82 million annually (46\%). This paper describes how factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to create a typology that was applied to quantify how usage patterns have evolved in different types of neighborhood. Having surged 40-fold, ridesourcing trips originating in the outer boroughs now constitute 56\% of the overall market. Many of the outer borough neighborhoods in which ridesourcing trips originated are home to minority, relatively low-income populations with low car ownership rates. It is possible that these trips in the outer boroughs are being taken by local residents to fill gaps in mobility services, as these locations are less well-served by public transportation and other for-hire vehicles such as yellow taxis. The surge in ridesourcing trips in the outer boroughs is important for three reasons. First, if ridesourcing is being used to provide desired levels of accessibility by outer borough residents, having this need filled by for-profit entities with notoriously variable pricing structures could have long-term consequences for transportation equity. Second, if the trips represent induced travel, the associated externalities will negatively affect vehicle emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and transportation safety. Third, local policy makers need to be aware of the dynamics unfolding in the outer boroughs because regulations that have been adopted to reduce congestion currently only apply to trips originating in Manhattan. Moreover, all stakeholders should reassess how disruptive transportation technology companies are regulated with respect to data sharing.},

This distinction is not only central to understanding the degrading nature of gig work, but to understanding the logic of what we describe as the fulfilment city -- a city organized around the promise and potential of one-click, same day, or even same hour, delivery services. We end by arguing that questions of waiting and fulfillment are important for migration scholars concerned with the formation of `immigrant counterpublics'.},

Using administrative data from Uber and a new representative survey of London drivers, we explore their backgrounds, earnings, and subjective well-being. We find that the vast majority of Uber drivers are male immigrants, primarily drawn from the bottom half of the London income distribution. Most transitioned out of permanent part- or full-time jobs and about half of drivers' report that their incomes increased after partnering with Uber. After covering vehicle operation costs and Uber's service fee, we estimate that the median London driver earns about {\pounds}11 per hour spent logged into the app. But while Uber drivers remain at the lower end of the London income distribution, they report higher levels of life satisfaction than other workers. Consistent with a trade-off between evaluative and emotional well-being observed among the self-employed, they also report higher anxiety levels. We hypothesize that the higher life satisfaction among Uber drivers partly reflects their preferences for flexibility and the autonomy that the platform offers. We provide suggestive evidence showing that drivers who emphasize flexibility as an important motivation to join Uber also report higher levels of subjective well-being. However, a minority of drivers who report that they would prefer work as an employee report lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of non-monetary factors in shaping the welfare of workers in the gig economy.},

  abstract = {A spate of recent scandals concerning personal digital data illustrates the extent to which innovation and finance are thoroughly entangled with one another. The innovation-finance nexus is an example of an emerging dynamic in technoscientific capitalism in which innovation is increasingly driven by the pursuit of ``economic rents''. Unlike innovation that delivers new products, services, and markets, innovation as rentiership is defined by the extraction and capture of value through different modes of ownership and control over resources and assets. This shift towards rentiership is evident in the transformation of personal digital data into a private asset. In light of this assetization, it is necessary to unpack how innovation itself might be a problem, rather than a solution to a range of global challenges. Our aim in this paper is to conceptualize this relationship between innovation, finance, and data rentiership, and examine the policy implications of this pursuit of economic rents as a deliberate research and innovation strategy in data-driven technology sectors.},

We contribute to this literature by examining more recent years of data, which capture a period during which Uber ridership has grown substantially and alcohol-involved fatalities have increased. Furthermore, we test whether the relationship between Uber availability and traffic fatalities depends on local characteristics. We employ multivariate regression models to test the association between Uber availability and total, alcohol-involved, and weekend and holiday-specific traffic fatalities in the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States between 2009 and 2017. We find that Uber availability is not associated with changes in total, alcohol-involved, and weekend and holiday-specific traffic fatalities in aggregate, yet it is associated with increased traffic fatalities in urban, densely populated counties.},

  abstract = {Background: Alcohol consumption is associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences and a leading cause of preventable deaths. Ride-hailing services such as Uber have been found to prevent alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities. These services may, however, facilitate alcohol consumption generally and binge drinking in particular. Objective: The goal of the research is to measure the impact of ride-hailing services on the extent and intensity of alcohol consumption. We allow these associations to depend on population density as the use of ride-hailing services varies across markets. Methods: We exploit the phased rollout of the ride-hailing platform Uber using a difference-in-differences approach. We use this variation to measure changes in alcohol consumption among a local population following Uber's entry. Data are drawn from Uber press releases to capture platform entry and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSS) Annual Survey to measure alcohol consumption in 113 metropolitan areas. Models are estimated using fixed-effects Poisson regression. Pre- and postentry trends are used to validate this approach. Results: Ride-hailing has no association with the extent of alcohol consumption in high (0.61 [95\% CI --0.05\% to 1.28\%]) or low (0.61 [95\% CI --0.05\% to 1.28\%]) density markets, but is associated with increases in the binge drinking rate in high-density markets (0.71 [95\% CI 0.13\% to 1.29\%]). This corresponds to a 4\% increase in binge drinking within a Metropolitan Statistical Area. Conclusions: Ride-hailing services are associated with an increase in binge drinking, which has been associated with a wide array of adverse health outcomes. Drunk driving rates have fallen for more than a decade, while binge drinking continues to climb. Both trends may be accelerated by ride-hailing services. This suggests that health information messaging should increase emphasis on the direct dangers of alcohol consumption and binge drinking.},

  abstract = {Participation in non-traditional work arrangements has increased dramatically over the last decade, including in settings where new technologies lower the transaction costs of providing labor flexibly. One prominent example of flexible work is the ride-sharing company Uber, which allows drivers to provide (or not provide) rides anytime they are willing to accept prevailing wages for providing this service. An Uber-style arrangement offers workers flexibility in both setting a customized work schedule and also adjusting the schedule from week to week, day to day, and hour to hour. Using data on hourly earnings for Uber drivers, we document the ways in which drivers utilize this real-time flexibility and we estimate the driver surplus generated by this flexibility. We estimate how drivers' reservation wages vary from hour to hour, which allows us to examine the surplus and supply implications of both flexible and traditional work arrangements. Our results indicate that, while the Uber relationship may have other drawbacks, Uber drivers benefit significantly from real-time flexibility, earning more than twice the surplus they would in less flexible arrangements. If required to supply labor inflexibly at prevailing wages, they would also reduce the hours they supply by more than two-thirds.},

A 50\% discount more than quadruples Uber usage and induces an increase of nearly 49\% in total mobility. These effects are stronger for women, who are less mobile at baseline and perceive public transit as unsafe. Technology-induced reductions in the price of ride-hailing services could generate substantial benefits to users (4.3\% of GDP) that would be accompanied by considerable increases in external costs (1\% of GDP), with benefits accruing to the most affluent and costs being borne by the entire population.},

We rely on Uber's ``surge'' pricing algorithm and the richness of its individual level data to first estimate demand elasticities at several points along the demand curve. We then use these elasticity estimates to estimate consumer surplus. Using almost 50 million individual-level observations and a regression discontinuity design, we estimate that in 2015 the UberX service generated about \$2.9 billion in consumer surplus in the four U.S. cities included in our analysis. For each dollar spent by consumers, about \$1.60 of consumer surplus is generated. Back-of-theenvelope calculations suggest that the overall consumer surplus generated by the UberX service in the United States in 2015 was \$6.8 billion.},

We approach this question through a categorization lens and explore in particular whether sharing economy companies can legitimately frame the individuals who work for them as ``independent workers'' and what this implies for the nature of the employment relationship in such on-demand business models. Our overall aim in doing this is twofold. First, we highlight and address an important categorization issue in our current society, which has potentially far-reaching consequences for the nature of employment and the securities and protections that workers used to enjoy in many parts of the world. Second, we advance prior research in the strategy and organizational domain by elaborating how acts of categorization are inherently moral and political in nature. In this way, we aim to provoke researchers toward studying the moral basis of categorization work and we provide pointers in this essay for how they might do so.},

Ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, which use modern internet-based mobile technology to connect passengers and drivers, have begun to compete with traditional taxis. This paper examines the efficiency of ride sharing services vis-{\`a}-vis taxis by comparing the capacity utilization rate of UberX drivers with that of traditional taxi drivers in five cities. The capacity utilization rate is measured by the fraction of time a driver has a fare-paying passenger in the car while he or she is working, and by the share of total miles that drivers log in which a passenger is in their car. The main conclusion is that, in most cities with data available, UberX drivers spend a significantly higher fraction of their time, and drive a substantially higher share of miles, with a passenger in their car than do taxi drivers. Four factors likely contribute to the higher capacity utilization rate of UberX drivers: 1) Uber's more efficient driver-passenger matching technology; 2) the larger scale of Uber than taxi companies; 3) inefficient taxi regulations; and 4) Uber's flexible labor supply model and surge pricing more closely match supply with demand throughout the day.},

Based on a survey of ride-hail users in the Philadelphia (PA) region, I examine who uses ride-hail and investigate ride-hail users' willingness to use ride-hail versus transit. My results suggest that more than one-quarter of respondents replaced transit with ride-hail in their last ride-hail trips. Mixed logit regression analysis based on stated preference choice experiments indicate that higher-income respondents and respondents over 30 years old are increasingly willing to choose ride-hail over transit, even though their actual ride-hail usage is lower than that among lower-income and younger respondents. Results also show that female respondents are more willing to choose ride-hail over transit than male respondents and less frequent transit users are more likely to choose ride-hail than frequent transit users. Higher cost and longer trip duration are significant deterrents for travel by either mode. Respondents consider the time spent on walking to and from transit more burdensome than in-vehicle travel time and wait time for transit and ride-hail. They consider waiting for ride-hail less burdensome than waiting for transit. Survey sampling and design limitations provide lessons for future ride-hail studies.Takeaway for practice: Practitioners should ensure convenient, affordable travel options for lower-income residents, who are more frequent but less willing ride-hail users than higher-income residents. Female respondents' safety concerns about transit should urge transit agencies to recognize female transit riders' travel needs. The relationship between age and willingness to use ride-hail reminds planners to anticipate greater substitution of ride-hail for transit as the more tech-savvy generation starts entering their 30s. Last, fare reduction alone may not be enough to prompt ride-hail users to switch to transit. Service improvements that shorten the overall trip duration are imperative to make transit more attractive.},

Existing research on the topic is limited by a lack of detailed data on the timing and location of TNC trips. This study overcomes that limitation by using data scraped from the Application Programming Interfaces of two TNCs, combined with Automated Passenger Count data on transit use and other supporting data. Using a panel data model of the change in bus ridership in San Francisco between 2010 and 2015, and confirming the result with a separate time-series model, we find that TNCs are responsible for a net ridership decline of about 10\%, offsetting net gains from other factors such as service increases and population growth. We do not find a statistically significant effect on light rail ridership. Cities and transit agencies should recognize the transit-competitive nature of TNCs as they plan, regulate and operate their transportation systems.},

What we call ``high-tech modernism''- the application of machine learning algorithms to organize our social, economic, and political life-has a dual logic. On the one hand, like traditional bureaucracy, it is an engine of classification, even if it categorizes people and things very differently. On the other, like the market, it provides a means of self-adjusting allocation, though its feedback loops work differently from the price system. Perhaps the most important consequence of high-tech modernism for the contemporary moral political economy is how it weaves hierarchy and data-gathering into the warp and woof of everyday life, replacing visible feedback loops with invisible ones, and suggesting that highly mediated outcomes are in fact the unmediated expression of people's own true wishes.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a rapid rise of on-demand ride-hailing platforms, such as Uber and Didi, which allow passengers with smart phones to submit trip requests and match them to drivers based on their locations and drivers' availability. This increased demand has raised questions about how such a new matching mechanism will affect the efficiency of the transportation system, in particular, whether it will help reduce passengers' average waiting time compared to traditional street-hailing systems.  In this talk, we shed light on this question by building a stylized model of a circular road and comparing the average waiting time of passengers under various matching mechanisms.  We discover the inefficiency in the on-demand ride-hailing system when the en-route time is long, which may result in non-monotonicity of passengers' average waiting time as passenger arrival rate increases. After identifying key tradeoffs between different mechanisms, we find that the on-demand matching mechanism could result in lower efficiency than the traditional street-hailing mechanism when the system utilization level is medium and the road length is long.  To overcome the disadvantage of both systems, we further propose adding response caps to the on-demand ride-hailing mechanism and develop a heuristic method to calculate a near-optimal cap. We also examine the impact of passenger abandonments, idle time strategies of taxis and traffic congestion on the performance of the ride-hailing systems. The results of this research would be instrumental for understanding the tradeoffs of the new service paradigm and thus enable policy makers to make more informed decisions when enacting regulations for this emerging service paradigm.},

Peer transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft present the opportunity to rectify long-standing discrimination or worsen it.

Results indicated a pattern of discrimination, which we observed in Seattle through longer waiting times for African American passengers---as much as a 35 percent increase. In Boston, we observed discrimination by Uber drivers via more frequent cancellations against passengers when they used African American-sounding names. Across all trips, the cancellation rate for African American sounding names was more than twice as frequent compared to white sounding names. Male passengers requesting a ride in low-density areas were more than three times as likely to have their trip canceled when they used a African American-sounding name than when they used a white-sounding name. We also find evidence that drivers took female passengers for longer, more expensive, rides in Boston. We observe that removing names from trip booking may alleviate the immediate problem but could introduce other pathways for unequal treatment of passengers.}

Accordingly, this study examines the personal and trip characteristics associated with ridehailing users? decisions to substitute other modes of travel or conduct new trips by ridehailing. Using detailed survey data collected in three California metropolitan regions from 2018 and 2019, we estimated an error components logit model of ridehailing users? choice of an alternative travel option if ridehailing services were unavailable. We found that over 50\% of ridehailing trips in our sample were replacing more sustainable modes (i.e., public transit, active modes, and carpooling) or were creating new vehicle miles, with a 5.8\% rate of induced travel, with public transit being the most frequently substituted mode. Respondents without a household vehicle and who use pooled services were more likely to replace transit. Longer-distance ridehailing trips were less likely to replace walking, biking, or transit trips. Respondents identifying as a racial or ethnic minority or lacking a household vehicle were least likely to cancel a trip were ridehailing unavailable, suggesting their use of ridehailing for essential rather than discretionary purposes. Together, these findings provide valuable insights for policy makers seeking to address the environmental and equity issues associated with ridehailing.},

We address this question using novel data and an innovative identification strategy. Our identification strategy relies on exogenous variation in local transit availability caused by rail expansions. Using proprietary, anonymized trip data from Uber for 35 countries, we use a dynamic difference-in-differences strategy to estimate how transit expansions affect local Uber ridership in 100 m distance bands centered on the new train station. Our estimates compare Uber ridership within a distance band before and after a train station opens relative to the next further out distance band. Total effects are obtained by aggregating relative effects at all further distance bands. We find that a new rail station opening increases Uber ridership within 100 m of the station by 60\%, and that this effect decays to zero for distances beyond 300 m. This sharp test implies Uber and rail transit are complements.},

  abstract = {Ride-haling such as Uber and Lyft are changing the ways people travel. Despite widespread claims that these services help reduce driving, there is little research on this topic. This research paper uses a quasi-natural experiment in the Denver, Colorado, region to analyze basic impacts of ride-hailing on transportation efficiency in terms of deadheading, vehicle occupancy, mode replacement, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Realizing the difficulty in obtaining data directly from Uber and Lyft, we designed a quasi-natural experiment---by one of the authors driving for both companies---to collect primary data. This experiment uses an ethnographic and survey-based approach that allows the authors to gain access to exclusive data and real-time passenger feedback. The dataset includes actual~travel attributes from 416 ride-hailing rides---Lyft, UberX, LyftLine, and UberPool---and travel behavior and socio-demographics from 311 passenger surveys. For this study, the conservative (lower end) percentage of deadheading miles from ride-hailing is 40.8\%. The average vehicle occupancy is 1.4 passengers per ride, while the distance weighted vehicle occupancy is 1.3 without accounting for deadheading and 0.8 when accounting deadheading. When accounting for mode replacement and issues such as driver deadheading, we estimate that ride-hailing leads to approximately 83.5\% more VMT than would have been driven had ride-hailing not existed. Although our data collection focused on the Denver region, these results provide insight into the impacts of ride-hailing.},

Our study uses trip-level data about Uber usage in New York City, turnstile data about subway usage, and trip-level data about taxicab and shared bike usage. We find that on the surface, ridesharing and subway usage are positively correlated. Exploiting a series of exogenous shocks to the system -- the closing of subway stations -- to better isolate substitution effects, our preliminary results suggest that the average shock results in an increase of over 30\% in the use of ridesharing, highlighting the potential for crowd-based systems to serve as infrastructure that helps smooth unexpected supply and demand surges. Our ongoing work studies how these substitution patterns vary with neighborhood socioeconomic indicators, and how substitution towards mobile-hailed ridesharing compares to traditional taxi and bike sharing. We hope to lay a data-driven foundation to better understand how sharing economy alternatives substitute and complement existing and future capital-intensive transit systems, and to provide a more judicious basis for assessing impacts on different population segments.},

The intention is to explore the possibility of using this measure as an accessibility proxy. A database was created with the mean waiting time data per district, which was aggregated to a set of socioeconomic and transport infrastructure variables. From this database, a multiple linear regression model was built. In addition, the stepwise method selected the most significant variables. Moran's I test confirmed the spatial distribution pattern of the measures, motivating the use of a spatial autoregressive model. The results indicate that physical variables, such as area and population density, are important to explain this relation. However, the mileage of district bus lines and the non-white resident rate were also significant. Besides, the spatial component indicates a possible relation to accessibility.},

Unfortunately, ridesharing services are not required to share data like taxi services, which has made it challenging to compare the competitive dynamics of these services, or assess their impact on cities. In this paper, we comprehensively compare Uber, Lyft, and taxis with respect to key market features (supply, demand, price, and wait time) in San Francisco and New York City. Based on point pattern statistics, we develop novel statistical techniques to validate our measurement methods. Using spatial lag models, we investigate the accessibility of VFH services, and find that transportation infrastructure and socio-economic features have substantial effects on VFH market features.},

Using Uber pickup data in New York City in 2014, this article investigates the spatiotemporal relationship between Uber and public transit using buffer analysis and spatial cross-correlation analysis and assesses Uber's impact on urban transportation equity with the Gini coefficient and correlation analysis. Our results confirm previous arguments that Uber both complements and competes with public transit, but competition is more prevalent in New York City. Specifically, Uber competes with public transit during most hours of the day and in areas with good public transit coverage, whereas it complements public transit at midnight and in places with insufficient public transit services. The distribution of Uber services is highly unequal, and Uber's role in improving transport equity is insignificant. Correlation analysis shows that there tend to be fewer Uber pickups in low-income areas, which diverges from previous studies suggesting that Uber serves low-income areas well. In addition, a weak negative correlation is detected between the number of Uber pickups and the percentage of minorities.},

The impact is assessed using a queuing theoretic equilibrium model which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing matching platform, the ride prices and driver wages established by the platform, and the incentives of passengers and drivers. We show that a floor placed under driver earnings can push the ride-hailing platform to hire more drivers and offer more rides, at the same time that passengers enjoy faster rides and lower total cost, while platform rents are reduced. Contrary to standard competitive labor market theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both drivers and passengers, and promotes the efficiency of the entire system. This surprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because the wage floor curbs TNC labor market power. In contrast to a wage floor, imposing a cap on the number of vehicles hurts drivers, because the platform reaps all the benefits of limiting supply. The congestion tax has the expected impact: fares increase, wages and platform revenue decrease. We also construct variants of the model to briefly discuss platform subsidy, platform competition, and autonomous vehicles.},

Using top 50 U.S. agency-level data from 2007 through 2017, this study examines the effect of TNCs and transit effectiveness on public transit ridership in the U.S. We find that (1) transit effectiveness of both bus and rail transits declined over the study period; (2) TNC availability increased rail transit ridership in 2015; (3) transit effectiveness was highly significant for public transit, and when examining its effect year-by-year, rail transit effectiveness trumped TNC availability; (4) TNCs are neither a complement nor a substitute of bus transit.},

  abstract = {As Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) have expanded their role in U.S. cities recently, their services (i.e. ridehailing) have been subject to scrutiny for displacing public transit (PT) ridership. Previous studies have attempted to classify the relationship between transit and TNCs, though analysis has been limited by a lack of granular TNC trip records, or has been conducted at aggregated scales. This study seeks to understand the TNC-PT relationship in Chicago at a spatially and temporally granular level by analyzing detailed individual trip records. An analysis framework is developed which enables TNC trips to be classified according to their potential relationship with transit: complementary (providing access to/from transit), substitutive (replacing a transit alternative), or independent (not desirably completable by transit). This framework is applied to both regular operating conditions and to early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify the TNC-PT relationship in these two contexts. We find that complementary TNC trips make up a small fraction of trips taken (approximately 2\%), while potential independent trips represent 48\% to 53\% and potential substitution trips represent 45\% to 50\%. The percentage of substitution trips drops substantially following COVID-19 shutdowns (to around 14\%). This may be attributed to a reduction in work-based TNC trips from Chicago's north side, indicated by changes in spatial distributions and flattening of trips occurring during peak hours. Furthermore, using spatial regression, we find that an increased tendency of TNC trips to substitute transit is related to a lower proportion of elderly people, greater proportion of peak-period TNC travel, greater transit network availability, a higher percentage of white population, and increased crime rates. Our findings identify spatial and temporal trends in the tendency to use TNC services in place of public transit, and thus have potential policy implications for transit management, such as spatially targeted service improvements and safety measures to reduce the possibility of public transit being substituted by TNC services.},

  abstract = {Governments around the world have been facing the challenges of regulating the ever-increasing prevalence of ridesharing platforms, leading to a proliferation of academic and policy debates about the social value of such platforms. However, the overall social value is still unclear because when analyzing the net benefit provided by ridesharing platforms, prior studies have focused on either supply side (i.e., drivers) or demand side (i.e., passengers) users without considering nonusers. Conversely, some studies that have considered the spillover effect of a ridesharing platform on nonusers have not simultaneously considered the net benefit for users. In this study, we propose that a hedonic pricing model can be used as a reasonably straightforward approach to collectively quantify the social value of a ridesharing platform for both users and nonusers. Using this approach, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the staggered entry of Uber into different metropolitan areas between 2010 and 2016 and find that the entry of Uber leads to, on average, a 2.8\% increase in median housing prices per square foot within a metropolitan area. We also find that there is substantial spatial heterogeneity, with benefits concentrated in areas with greater dependence on public transportation and higher levels of traffic delay. By quantitatively computing the social value of a ridesharing platform with a hedonic pricing model, our study helps government regulators generate policies that are more likely to promote public welfare and become less susceptible to political whims.},

  abstract = {Sharing economy reshapes the distribution of unused or underutilized asset through digital platforms to individuals who are willing to pay for the services. The new economy model has introduced dramatic impact on the traditional industries by matching the demand and supply in real time. In this paper, we examine how the entry of Uber, a ride-sharing services digital platform, influences the demand of public transportation. Significant debate has surrounded whether the new ride-sharing model siphoned riders from public transit, or made transit feasible for more riders. However, limited empirical research has been done to uncover whether Uber is helping or hurting public transportation systems. Leveraging a natural experiment setting, the entry of Uber, with a difference-in-differences approach, we find a significant drop in the number of passenger trips with bus. Further, our results suggest that the effect of Uber is not uniform -- the reduction in bus passenger trips is mitigated when the proportion of old age people in a local urban area is large; the decrease is amplified when the populations of disable people, including with language difficulty, and self-employed people are large. However, the moderating effect of poverty is mixed. We discuss the implications for research and practice.},

  abstract = {The popularity of Uber and Lyft and advances in autonomous vehicle technology have spurred public interest in the potential of shared ride services to reduce traffic congestion, vehicle emissions and space devoted to parking. However, research has shown that long waiting times, circuitous routes and privacy concerns might lead most patrons to choose exclusive-ride services over shared services (ride-hail or autonomous), thus increasing rather than decreasing vehicle mileage. This paper uses Uber and Lyft experience from 2014 to 2020 to examine the effectiveness of shared (or ``pooled'') services in reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in four cities with large concentrations of ride-hail trips and suburban areas of California. Taking into account three key inputs -- pooling rates, modal shifts and deadhead miles -- results show that pre-pandemic levels of pooling led to at least a doubling of VMT when comparing ride-hail trips with patrons' previous mode, with increases of 97\% in Chicago, 114\% in New York City, 118\% in San Francisco, 157\% in Boston and 118\% in California suburbs. These large VMT increases are driven by the addition of dead-head miles before each pick-up and the absence of offsetting VMT reductions among travelers who switch to ride-hail from public transportation, biking and walking. VMT increases are only modestly mitigated by the use of ride-hail for ``first mile/last mile'' trips to connect to public transportation or by reduced cruising for parking by drivers in their personal vehicles. In sum, ride-hail adds to vehicle mileage for trips associated with ride-hail even taking into account pooling. This pattern is likely to endure in a world of autonomous vehicles given that auto users tend to switch to solo services due to considerations of travel time, reliability, comfort and privacy, while pooled options mainly draw patrons from sustainable modes like public transportation. The implication for public policy is that in dense urban areas, it remains important for policy-makers to prioritize space-efficient modes of public transportation, walking and biking. At the same time, ride-hail can clearly be valuable to meet specific needs such as providing paratransit services to people with disabilities, providing first and last mile connections to transit services and connecting late-night workers to jobs. These results will be important as cities emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and navigate a path to economic recovery, social equity, and environmental sustainability.},

  abstract = {Training modern deep learning models requires large amounts of computation, often provided by GPUs. Scaling computation from one GPU to many can enable much faster training and research progress but entails two complications. First, the training library must support inter-GPU communication. Depending on the particular methods employed, this communication may entail anywhere from negligible to significant overhead. Second, the user must modify his or her training code to take advantage of inter-GPU communication. Depending on the training library's API, the modification required may be either significant or minimal. Existing methods for enabling multi-GPU training under the TensorFlow library entail non-negligible communication overhead and require users to heavily modify their model-building code, leading many researchers to avoid the whole mess and stick with slower single-GPU training. In this paper we introduce Horovod, an open source library that improves on both obstructions to scaling: it employs efficient inter-GPU communication via ring reduction and requires only a few lines of modification to user code, enabling faster, easier distributed training in TensorFlow.

  abstract = {Shared mobility---the shared use of a motor vehicle, bicycle, or other mode---enables travelers to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an as-needed basis. The term ``shared mobility'' includes the modes of carsharing, personal vehicle sharing (peer-to-peer carsharing and fractional ownership), bikesharing, scooter sharing, traditional ridesharing, transportation network companies (or ridesourcing), and e-Hail (taxis). It can also include flexible transit services, including microtransit, which supplement fixed-route bus and rail services. Shared mobility has proliferated in global cities not only as an innovative transportation mode enhancing urban mobility but also as a potential solution for addressing first- and last-mile connectivity with public transit. It can extend the catchment area of public transportation, potentially playing a pivotal role in bridging gaps in the existing transportation network and encouraging multimodality for first- and last-mile trips rather than driving alone. While public transit is often constrained by fixed routes, driver availability, and vehicle scheduling, shared mobility's ``ondemand'' access provides the flexibility that travelers need to access or egress from a bus or rail ``trunk line.'' Moreover, shared mobility provides an alternative to costly feeder bus services and land-intensive parking infrastructure. This paper discusses the history of shared mobility within the context of the urban transportation landscape, first in Europe and Asia, and more recently in the Americas, with a specific focus on first- and last-mile connections to public transit. The authors discuss the known impacts of shared mobility modes---carsharing, bikesharing, and ridesharing---on reducing vehicle miles/kilometers traveled (VMT/VKT), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and modal splits with public transit. The future of shared mobility in the urban transportation landscape is discussed, as mobile technology and public policy continue to evolve to integrate shared mobility with public transit and future automated vehicles.},

The size of this gain depends in part on whether these innovations permit transactions previously costly or infeasible. Using New York City --- the largest taxi market in the country --- as its context, this paper estimates the level of any technological advantage Uber has over hail taxis in matching to consumers. I combine publicly available transportation data with data scraped from Uber and traffic cameras to estimate a model of the demand for transportation services and imbed it in a spatial equilibrium framework in which Uber and taxis compete for customers. I find that Uber's matching advantage depends on the density of the market and translates into highly heterogeneous benefits to customers across the city. In consumer welfare terms, I estimate that the introduction of Uber added only \$0.10 per ride in the densest parts of New York but over \$1.00 in the least dense. These results, combined with the high volume of substitution from taxis to Uber in central Manhattan, imply Uber's appeal in its densest market has depended significantly on advantages independent from its matching technology, including its lower regulatory burden.},

K-means clustering is applied for initial data exploration. Based on the spatial model selection diagnostic tests, we developed maximum likelihood spatial lag models with queen contiguity spatial weight matrix. The results show that Uber accessibility is not balanced in different neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Uber is more accessible in denser areas with the high male population, better public transportation access and less access to amenities in the walkable distances. Moreover, we observed that Uber is more accessible in areas with a high crime rate. This observation shows that Uber has made it easier to get out of high crime rate areas. Finally, contribution in the literature on accessibility in ride-sourcing networks is discussed. Findings are additionally used to provide managerial implications to mitigate discrimination in ride-sourcing platforms.

In the context of ride-hailing platforms, it has been observed that drivers strategically exploit the structure of such pricing policies by coordinating with each other to deactivate some drivers in order to create an artificial shortage of supply capacity and trigger so-called surge pricing. We develop a simple and high-level analytical framework to structurally characterize the drivers of such collusive behavior and the consequences for drivers and the platform. We find that collusive driver behavior is more likely in settings where customers exhibit moderate sensitivity to waiting time. For some of these cases, if customers continue to request service under driver collusion, the platform may benefit from the higher surge prices. For settings where driver collusion is harmful to the platform, we consider two possible mitigation strategies: a bonus payment structure to eliminate the drivers' incentives to collude, which comes at a direct cost to the platform, and a freeze period after deactivating the app during which drivers cannot reactivate. We show that with the appropriate duration, such a freeze period can effectively eliminate driver collusion without any direct costs to the platform.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of the sharing economy and the rapid growth of mobile communications technologies, many novel sharing services models have been developed stemming from ride- hailing. Urban traffic congestion, coupled with energy conservation and emissions reduction, has prompted research on enhancing vehicle seat utilization in taxi service. To offer more effective and reliable ride-hailing, we consider ride-sharing problem with passenger transfer that allows passengers to transfer between vehicles at transfer stations. The problem requires simultaneous addressing the issues of request dispatching, transfer scheduling, and vehicle rebalancing. Studying such a ride-hailing model, we propose a novel joint decision framework combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with integer-linear programming (ILP) to solve the problem. We use ILP to obtain the optimal online dispatching and matching strategy in each decision stage, and DRL to learn the approximate state value of each vehicle that incorporates with some strategies to limit the state space and reduce the computational complexity. Performing numerical studies on the real-world trip dataset in Chengdu, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, and that ride-sharing with passenger transfer is more beneficial than traditional ride-sharing.}

Without any prior assumption, this paper openly explores spatial disparities of accessibility in the city of Atlanta, USA using both the UberX (the most popular Uber product) and the UberBLACK (the premium Uber product) data. Accessibility is measured by both the expectation and variability of Uber wait time. With spatial autoregressive models, we find that after controlling for other socioeconomic factors, wealth and race do not have significant associations with Uber accessibility. Additionally, higher road network density, population density, and less commuting time to work correlate with greater Uber accessibility. More public transport stops are related to better accessibility of UberX but worse accessibility of UberBLACK. Finally, implications for policy-makers are provided.},

  abstract = {On-demand ridesourcing services from transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, have reshaped urban travel and changed externality costs from vehicle emissions, congestion, crashes, and noise. To quantify these changes, we simulate replacing private vehicle travel with TNCs in six U.S. cities. On average, we find a 50--60\% decline in air pollutant emission externalities from NOx, PM2.5, and VOCs due to avoided ``cold starts'' and relatively newer, lower-emitting TNC vehicles. However, increased vehicle travel from deadheading creates a {$\sim$}20\% increase in fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions and a {$\sim$}60\% increase in external costs from congestion, crashes, and noise. Overall, shifting private travel to TNCs increases external costs by 30--35\% (adding 32--37 ¢ of external costs per trip, on average). This change in externalities increases threefold when TNCs displace transit or active transport, drops by 16--17\% when TNC vehicles are zero-emission electric, and potentially results in reduced externalities when TNC rides are pooled.}

We build an queueing model to approximate the dynamics of the on-demand service platform that provides two services: a standard service and a carpooling service. We find that two factors influence the efficiency of the carpooling service: the source of customers who use the carpooling service, and the length of a normalized detour. If the carpooling service attracts customers who have not used on-demand service before, i.e., the market size increases, then both the customer waiting time and driver utilization increase when more customers use the carpooling service. If the carpooling service primarily attracts customers who already use the standard on-demand service before, i.e., customers switch from the standard service to the carpooling service, then the impact of the carpooling service depends on the normalized detour. It is possible that customer waiting time and driver utilization first increase and then decrease as customers switch from the standard service to the carpooling service.},

A key to resolving these challenges is to understand how drivers set up their work schedule so as to inform management decisions. This letter summarizes our investigation of ride-sourcing drivers' working hour decisions. Leveraging comprehensive data from Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing company in China, we calibrate two classic models from previous studies on taxi labor markets to examine drivers' reactions to earnings in deciding their working hours. Our results suggest that, when deciding whether to continue a shift, drivers pay more attention to future income opportunities and the time already spent working rather than their current earning level.},

The theory and technologies behind these platforms have become one of the most active research topics in the fields of economics, operations research, computer science, and transportation engineering. In particular, advanced matching and dynamic pricing (DP) algorithms---the two key levers in ride-hailing---have received tremendous attention from the research community and are continuously being designed and implemented at industrial scales by ride-hailing platforms. We provide a review of matching and DP techniques in ride-hailing, and show that they are critical for providing an experience with low waiting time for both riders and drivers. Then we link the two levers together by studying a pool-matching mechanism called dynamic waiting (DW) that varies rider waiting and walking before dispatch, which is inspired by a recent carpooling product Express Pool from Uber. We show using data from Uber that by jointly optimizing DP and DW, price variability can be mitigated, while increasing capacity utilization, trip throughput, and welfare. We also highlight several key practical challenges and directions of future research from a practitioner's perspective.},

Previous studies explored the effects of built environment factors on WT based on estimated WT but did not control for trip-level characteristics, which may lead to biased parameter estimation. Thus, we further study this topic by using the actual WT recorded by the RideAustrin platform and considering trip-level variables. The single-level and multilevel proportional hazards models are constructed, and model comparison shows that the multilevel model performs better. We find that waiting time is positively correlated with trip-level characteristics such as traffic conditions, surge multiplier, and rainy weather. Regarding built environment factors, WT is positively related to distance to CBD and negatively related to road density, transit stop density, and land-use entropy. WT is also higher in areas with a high fraction of Hispanic/Latino and Black residents but lower in areas of low income.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ridesharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing last-mile connectivity to extend transit's catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named MTransit, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data and fit a RP-SP mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for MTransit use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for MTransit under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.}

  abstract = {Policymakers in cities worldwide are trying to determine how ride-hailing services affect the ridership of traditional forms of public transportation. The level of convenience and comfort that these services provide is bound to take riders away from transit, but by operating in areas, or at times, when transit is less frequent, they may also be filling a gap left vacant by transit operations. These contradictory effects reveal why we should not merely categorize all ride-hailing services as a substitute or supplement to transit, and demonstrate the need to examine ride-hailing trips individually. Using data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey in Toronto, we investigate the differences in travel-times between observed ride-hailing trips and their fastest transit alternatives. Ordinary least squares and ordered logistic regressions are used to uncover the characteristics that influence travel-time differences. We find that ride-hailing trips contained within the City of Toronto, pursued during peak hours, or for shopping purposes, are more likely to have transit alternatives of similar duration. Also, we find differences in travel-time often to be caused by transfers and lengthy walk- and wait-times for transit. Our results further indicate that 31\% of ride-hailing trips in our sample have transit alternatives of similar duration ({$\leq$}15~minute difference). These are particularly damaging for transit agencies as they compete directly with services that fall within reasonable expectations of transit service levels. We also find that 27\% of ride-hailing trips would take at least 30~minutes longer by transit, evidence for significant gap-filling opportunity of ride-hailing services. In light of these findings, we discuss recommendations for ride-hailing taxation structures.},

  abstract = {Pooled ride-hailing services such as UberPool are believed to contribute towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion, and have caught the attention of policymakers, as they align much closer to sustainable transport objectives. The relative sustainability of these services depends on their ability to successfully match riders for pooled trips. Accordingly, this paper examines the matching propensity of shared ridehailing services and explores the detour penalty associated with pooling, as this impacts the uptake and viability of shared services. Using a 12-million record dataset of every ridehailing trip conducted in Toronto between September 2016 and March 2017, we determine that 15\% of ride-hailing trips were pooled, but that only 52\% of these were actually matched. A probit model reveals that higher demand and longer trip distances significantly improve matching propensity. We also examine the detour penalty associated with pooling and find that successfully matched shared ride-hailing trips only took 3.6 minutes longer, on average, than comparable non-shared trips. Our findings imply that reducing the detour time associated with pooling to attract more riders may ultimately increase the likelihood that shared trips go unmatched, negating the sustainability benefits of the service.},

  abstract = {Urban anomalies bring uncertainties to society, urban transportation systems, and businesses. Some urban anomalies, such as no-notice and/or unpredictable terrorist attacks or other urban strikes, if not handled in timely ways may result in loss of life or property and pose tremendous risks to public safety overall. Previous studies have focused on developing emergency-management technology but without in-depth analysis exploring how technology-mediated digital systems perform in reality. Besides, the recent literature has demonstrated significant interest in analyzing and comparing the traditional on-demand service (i.e., taxies) and ridesharing platforms (e.g., Uber). The majority of prior studies have focused on their complementary roles in determining environmental conditions. Little is known, however, regarding how and why the two types of platforms perform in contexts of uncertainty (e.g., under emergency situations). This paper aims to bridge this literature gap. Specifically, we consider different types of unexpected urban anomalies (including terrorist attacks, car crashes, and subway shutdowns) and collect large-scale trip data on taxi and ridesharing services. Empirically, we employ a difference-in-differences econometric model to compare the platform-level performances (measured by the number of fulfilled trips) of a traditional taxi system and a ridesharing platform after urban anomaly shocks. We observe that the ridesharing platform significantly outperforms the traditional taxi platform in coping with the uncertainties brought about by unexpected anomalies. We conduct a set of robustness checks to verify our findings and propose multiple possibilities to explain them. We conclude, conservatively, that the technological effect and the technology-enabled supply elasticity of the digital platforms are the main factors determining the differences between the platforms during an urban anomaly. This work offers important insights into the design of platform strategies, especially for the stimulation of the labor supply and incentivization of the adoption and use of technology in urban transportation systems in response to anomalous urban upheavals.
