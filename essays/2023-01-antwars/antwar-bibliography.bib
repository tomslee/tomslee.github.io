	abstract = {Chemical communication is central for the formation and maintenance of insect societies. Generally, social insects only allow nest-mates into their colony, which are recognized by their cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). Social parasites, which exploit insect societies, are selected to circumvent host recognition. Here, we studied whether chemical strategies to reduce recognition evolved convergently in slavemaking ants, and whether they extend to workers, queens and males alike. We studied CHCs of three social parasites and their related hosts to investigate whether the parasitic lifestyle selects for specific chemical traits that reduce host recognition. Slavemaker profiles were characterized by shorter-chained hydrocarbons and a shift from methyl-branched alkanes to
              n
              -alkanes, presumably to reduce recognition cue quantity. These shifts were consistent across independent origins of slavery and were found in isolated ants and those emerging in their mother colony. Lifestyle influenced profiles of workers most profoundly, with little effect on virgin queen profiles. We detected an across-species caste signal, with workers, for which nest-mate recognition is particularly important, carrying more and longer-chained hydrocarbons and males exhibiting a larger fraction of
              n
              -alkanes. This comprehensive study of CHCs across castes and species reveals how lifestyle-specific selection can result in convergent evolution of chemical phenotypes.},

	abstract = {How animals recognize conspecific individuals has important outcomes in many contexts, but interactions among group members are particularly important. Two recognition criteria are often implicated in these interactions: kin recognition is based on relatedness cues and nestmate recognition is based on familiarity. For social insects, both types of recognition are possible, as many nestmates are close kin and familiarity can develop among individuals that encounter each other repeatedly. To discern whether social insects use kin or nestmate recognition, it is necessary to simultaneously assess how relatedness and familiarity influence behaviour. The facultatively social eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, offers an excellent opportunity to study how either nestmate or kin recognition (or both) may influence interactions among nestmates, as many females disperse from their natal nests in spring, and often attempt to join new colonies that may contain unrelated individuals. This leads to frequent behavioural interactions among females that may be related or unrelated, and familiar or unfamiliar. We used observation nests and microsatellite loci to assess the influence of familiarity and relatedness on behavioural interactions during the early phase of colony development, when females establish reproductive queues prior to brood production. Females were more likely to feed and were less aggressive to familiar rather than related nestmates, regardless of their relatedness. This suggests that eastern carpenter bees primarily use learned cues to discriminate among nestmates. Interactions with nestmates were also context-dependent, as females returning to the nest without food were the recipients of more aggression than those returning with food. If spring dispersal leads to reduced relatedness in X. virginica colonies, then nestmate recognition based on familiarity would be an important factor in maintaining group cohesion.},

	abstract = {A diversity of arthropods (myrmecophiles) thrives within ant nests, many of them unmolested though some, such as the specialized Eucharitidae parasitoids, may cause direct damage to their hosts. Ants are known to discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates, but whether they recognize the strength of a threat and their capacity to adjust their behavior accordingly have not been fully explored. We aimed to determine whether Ectatomma tuberculatum ants exhibited specific behavioral responses to potential or actual intruders posing different threats to the host colony and to contribute to an understanding of complex ant-eucharitid interactions. Behavioral responses differed significantly according to intruder type. Ants evicted intruders that represented a threat to the colony’s health (dead ants) or were not suitable as prey items (filter paper, eucharitid parasitoid wasps, non myrmecophilous adult weevils), but killed potential prey (weevil larvae, termites). The timing of detection was in accordance with the nature and size of the intruder: corpses (a potential source of contamination) were detected faster than any other intruder and transported to the refuse piles within 15 min. The structure and complexity of behavioral sequences differed among those intruders that were discarded. Workers not only recognized and discriminated between several distinct intruders but also adjusted their behavior to the type of intruder encountered. Our results confirm the previously documented recognition capabilities of E. tuberculatum workers and reveal a very fine-tuned intruder discrimination response. Colony-level prophylactic and hygienic behavioral responses through effective removal of inedible intruders appears to be the most general and flexible form of defense in ants against a diverse array of intruders. However, this generalized response to both potentially lethal and harmless intruders might have driven the evolution of ant-eucharitid interactions, opening a window for parasitoid attack and allowing adult parasitoid wasps to quickly leave the natal nest unharmed.},

	abstract = {In social insect colonies, individuals need to communicate to coordinate cooperative tasks and protect the colony and its resources against intruders. To maintain colony integrity, it can be particularly important to recognize nestmates and discriminate against non-nestmate conspecifics and heterospecific predators and parasites. As typical intruders are either con- or heterospecific adults, the mechanisms underlying recognition and discrimination processes in interactions among adults have been well described. Ant brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae) can also play a key role in social interactions, and brood is of special importance when it comes to the priorities of worker ants. However, whether ants can, or even need to, recognize brood of different origins, is not always clear. In this review, we integrate the results of 100 years of study on brood recognition and discrimination in ants into a general framework. We begin with an overview of the proximate mechanisms involved in brood recognition and discrimination. We then discuss why brood recognition and discrimination should evolve and review the evidence for brood recognition on three organizational levels: within nests, between conspecifics and between species. We conclude by examining the constraints acting on accurate recognition and/or discrimination. With this review, we hope to inspire future research on the fascinating life of ant brood.},

	abstract = {Social insects have evolved an array of individual and social behaviours that limit pathogen entrance and spread within the colony. The detection of ectoparasites or of fungal spores on a nestmate body triggers their removal by allogrooming and appears as a primary component of social prophylaxis. However, in the case of fungal infection, one may wonder whether ant workers are able to detect, discriminate and keep at bay diseased nestmates that have no spores over their cuticle but which constitute a latent sanitary risk due to post-mortem corpse sporulation. Here, we investigate the ability of Myrmica rubra workers to detect and discriminate a healthy from a diseased nestmate infected by the entomopathogen Metarhizium anisopliae. During dyadic encounters in a neutral location, workers were more aggressive towards isolated sick nestmates on the 3rd post-infection day. However, no such detection or discrimination of fungus-infected nestmates occurred in a social context inside the nest or at the nest entrance. Gatekeepers never actively rejected incoming diseased nestmates that rather spontaneously isolated themselves outside the nest. Our study reveals that ant workers may detect health-dependent cues and that their ‘acceptance level’ of sick nestmates is tunable depending on the social context. This raises questions about possible trade-offs between a social closure to pathogens and risks of erroneous rejection of healthy nestmates. Social isolation of moribund ants also appears as a widespread prophylactic strategy of social insects allowing them to reduce exposure to pathogens and to spare costs associated with the management of infected individuals.},

	abstract = {Nestmate recognition in ants is based on cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which are heritable and may also be acquired from the environment (i.e. diet and nest environment). In Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), diet and a homogenous environment have been shown to affect nestmate recognition by altering the CHC profile and consequently intraspecific aggression. In our study, Argentine ants were collected from field nests representing two supercolonies in South Africa. Individuals were paired in aggression assays and their CHC profiles analysed. The same nests used in the aggression assays were maintained in the laboratory for five months on a shared diet of crickets and sugar water, in soil-free nests. We predicted that aggression between previously aggressive paired individuals from different nests would decrease over time through the homogenisation of CHCs as a consequence of the shared diet and similar nesting environment. Our data showed that ants maintained in the laboratory readily absorbed prey-derived hydrocarbons and experienced a loss in the number of cuticular compounds compared with their original CHC profiles. However, the changes in CHCs did not impair nestmate recognition with non-aggressive paired interactions maintained while previously aggressive paired interactions persisted. The persistence of aggression between previously aggressive pairs despite environmental homogeneity supports the notion that intrinsic nestmate recognition cues are not overridden by extrinsic cues in the recognition system of Argentine ants.},

Therefore, it is predicted that animals will display aggression only when the expected benefit to individual fitness exceeds the expected cost. In ants, when conspecific individuals belonging to different colonies encounter each other, fighting occurs, seemingly facultatively. However, the context that influences the expression of ants’ aggressive behavior, especially in the field, is still largely unknown. We investigated the plasticity of aggressiveness toward non-nestmates in Diacamma sp. from Japan. Our field experiment clearly showed that the same foragers that were aggressive toward non-nestmates in the vicinity of their nest changed to be non-aggressive at greater distances from the nest. Furthermore, the size of the colony to which the foragers belonged weakly but significantly affected their aggressiveness: foragers belonging to larger colonies behaved more aggressively toward non-nestmates. We discuss the possible adaptive significance of the observed facultative aggression between conspecific non-nestmates.

	abstract = {In order to make effective collective decisions, ants lay pheromone trails to lead nest-mates to acceptable food sources. The strength of a trail informs other ants about the quality of a food source, allowing colonies to exploit the most profitable resources. However, recruiting too many ants to a single food source can lead to over-exploitation, queuing, and thus decreased food intake for the colony. The nonlinear nature of pheromonal recruitment can also lead colonies to become trapped in suboptimal decisions, if the environment changes. Negative feedback systems can ameliorate these problems. We investigated a potential source of negative feedback: whether the presence of nest-mates makes food sources more or less attractive.
              Lasius niger
              workers were trained to food sources of identical quality, scented with different odours. Ants fed alone at one odour. At the other odour ants fed either with other feeding nest-mates, or with dummy ants (black surface lipid-coated glass beads). Ants tended to avoid food sources at which other nest-mates were present. They also deposited less pheromone to occupied food sources, suggesting an active avoidance behaviour, and potentiating negative feedback. This effect may prevent crowding at a single food source when other profitable food sources are available elsewhere, leading to a higher collective food intake. It could also potentially protect colonies from becoming trapped in local feeding optima. However, ants did not avoid the food associated with dummy ants, suggesting that surface lipids and static visual cues alone may not be sufficient for nest-mate recognition in this context.},

	abstract = {A basic expectation of evolution by natural selection is that species morphologies will adapt to their ecological niche. In social organisms, this may include selective pressure from the social environment. Many nonant parasites of ant colonies are known to mimic the morphology of their host species, often in striking fashion [1, 2], indicating there is selection on parasite morphology to match the host (Batesian and/or Wasmannian mimicry [3]). However, ants that parasitize other ant societies are usually closely related to their hosts (Emery’s rule) [4–8] and expected to be similar due to common ancestry, making any kind of mimicry difﬁcult to detect [9]. Here, we investigate the diversiﬁcation of the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole in Madagascar, including the evolution of 13 putative social parasite species within a broader radiation of over 100 ant species on the island. We ﬁnd that the parasitic species are monophyletic and that their associated hosts are spread across the Malagasy Pheidole radiation. This provides an opportunity to test for selection on morphological similarity and divergence between parasites and hosts. Using X-ray microtomography and both linear measurements and three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics, we show that ant social parasite worker morphologies feature a mix of ‘‘host-matching’’ and ‘‘parasitic’’ traits, where the former converge on the host phenotype and the latter diverge from typical Pheidole phenotypes to match a common parasitic syndrome. This ﬁnding highlights the role of social context in shaping the evolution of phenotypes and raises questions about the role of morphological sensing in nestmate recognition.},

It has been suggested that a mismatch between a chemical signature (label) and the internal, neuronal representation of the colony odor (template) leads to aggression between non-nestmates. Moreover, a definitive demonstration that odorant receptors are responsible for the processing of the chemical signals that regulate nestmate recognition has thus far been lacking. To address these issues, we have developed an aggression-based bioassay incorporating highly selective modulators that target odorant receptor functionality to characterize their role in nestmate recognition in the formicine ant Camponotus floridanus. Electrophysiological studies were used to show that exposure to either a volatilized antagonist or an agonist eliminated or dramatically altered signaling, respectively. Administration of these compounds to adult workers significantly reduced aggression between non-nestmates without altering aggression levels between nestmates. These studies provide direct evidence that odorant receptors are indeed necessary and sufficient for mediating aggression towards non-nestmates. Furthermore, our observations support a hypothesis in which rejection of non-nestmates depends on the precise decoding of chemical signatures present on non-nestmates as opposed to the absence of any information or the active acceptance of familiar signatures.},

Within these species profiles quantitative variations in the chemical profile allows distinct colony-specific odours to arise (chemotypes) that are shared by all colony members. This help maintains social cohesion, including defence of their colonies against all intruders, including con-specifics. How these colony -level chemotypes are maintained among nest-mates has long been debated. The two main theories are; each ant is able to biochemically adjust its chemical profile to ‘match’ that of its nest-mates and or the queen, or all nest-mates share their individually generated chemical profile via trophollaxis resulting in an average nest-mate profile. This ‘mixing’ idea is better known as the Gestalt model. Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to experimentally test these two ideas in a single experimental design. However, it is now possible using the ant Formica exsecta because the compounds used in nest-mate recognition compounds are known. We demonstrate that workers adjust their profile to ‘match’ the dominant chemical profile within that colony, hence maintaining the colony-specific chemotype and indicates that a ‘gestalt’ mechanism, i.e. profile mixing, plays no or only a minor role.},

	abstract = {Nestmate recognition is the process by which individuals discriminate between nestmates and con- and hetero-specifics. Nestmate recognition is based on recognition cues, which include cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). Models of nestmate recognition predict that recognition decisions are based on the overlap of recognition cues. Colony recipients assess cue differences by comparing an individual's CHC profile to an internal template, which is based on the colony-specific cues. The behavioral response to this assessment depends on cue similarities or differences with the template. Ants show graded responses to cue differences. More recent models of nestmate recognition include adjustable thresholds that account for graded responses and intra-colony individual variation in behavioral responses towards non-nestmates. Ants display differing levels of aggression towards conspecifics under different contexts, which suggests that nestmate recognition is context-dependent. Here, we review models of decision rules and the role of CHCs in nestmate recognition. We discuss the role of ecological and social context in nestmate recognition, and explore future directions of research for the field.},

	abstract = {Insect societies are a paramount example of efficiency based upon division of labour. Social insect workers specialize on different tasks, such as brood care and foraging. This polyethism is underlined by the development of brain and olfactory organs. Nestmate recognition in ants is based on perception of chemical cues through olfaction; therefore, we asked whether task polyethism affects the ability of ants to discriminate friends from foes. We used the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops to investigate the ability of three behavioural groups of worker (foragers, nurses and inactives) in recognizing intruders. Foragers, which are older workers mainly performing tasks outside the nest, showed higher levels of aggression towards intruders than nurses did. Foragers appeared to be more efficient at recognizing non-nestmate cues than did intra-nidal workers (nurses and inactives), and they possibly have higher motivation to attack. This suggests that ant workers change their olfactory sensitivity to non-nestmate stimuli during their life. This plasticity could be adaptive, as younger workers, who typically stay inside the nest, usually do not encounter intruders, while older workers have more experience outside the nest and differently developed neural circuits. A sensitive nestmate recognition system would thus be an unnecessary cost early in life.},

	abstract = {The ecological and evolutionary success of social insects relies on their ability to efﬁciently discriminate between group members and aliens. Nestmate recognition occurs by phenotype matching, the comparison of the referent (colony) phenotype to the one of an encountered individual. Based on the level of dissimilarity between the two, the discriminator accepts or rejects the target. The tolerated degree of mismatch is predicted by the acceptance threshold model, which assumes adaptive threshold shifts depending on the costs of discrimination errors. Inherent in the model is that rejection (type I) and acceptance (type II) errors are reciprocally related: if one type decreases, the other increases. We studied whether alarm pheromones modulate the acceptance threshold. We exposed Camponotus aethiops ants to formic acid and subsequently measured aggression toward nestmates and nonnestmates. Formic acid induced both more nonnestmate rejection and more nestmate acceptance than a control treatment, thus uncovering an unexpected effect of an alarm pheromone on responses to nestmates. Nestmate discrimination accuracy was improved via a decrease in both types of errors, a result that cannot be explained by a shift in the acceptance threshold. We propose that formic acid increases the amount of information available to the ants, thus decreasing the perceived phenotypic overlap between nestmate and nonnestmate recognition cues. This mechanism for improved discrimination reveals a novel function of alarm pheromones in recognition processes and may have far-reaching implications in our understanding of the modus operandi of recognition systems in general.},

	abstract = {Ultrasociality refers to the social organization of a few species, including humans and some social insects, having a complex division of labor, city-states, and an almost exclusive dependence on agriculture for subsistence. We argue that the driving forces in the evolution of these ultrasocial societies were economic. With the agricultural transition, species could directly produce their own food and this was such a competitive advantage that those species now dominate the planet. Once underway, this transition was propelled by the selection of within-species groups that could best capture the advantages of (1) actively managing the inputs to food production, (2) a more complex division of labor, and (3) increasing returns to larger scale and larger group size. Together these factors reoriented productive life and radically altered the structure of these societies. Once agriculture began, populations expanded as these economic drivers opened up new opportunities for the exploitation of resources and the active management of inputs to food production. With intensified group-level competition, larger populations and intensive resource exploitation became competitive advantages, and the “social conquest of Earth” was underway. Ultrasocial species came to dominate the earth's ecosystems. Ultrasociality also brought a loss of autonomy for individuals within the group. We argue that exploring the common causes and consequences of ultrasociality in humans and the social insects that adopted agriculture can provide fruitful insights into the evolution of complex human society.},

	abstract = {In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial Ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. 
The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.   Combinations of Artificial Ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing. The burgeoning activity in this field has led to conferences dedicated solely to Artificial Ants, and to numerous commercial applications by specialized companies such as AntOptima.
As an example, Ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.  One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.
This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.},

These include the noctuid moths Helicoverpa and Spodoptera, whose caterpillars have long been among the worst pests in their native Old and New World habitats, respectively, and the whitefly Bemisia, a major vector of plant virus diseases. Importantly, genomic resources for these species have recently become available, allowing research to move beyond the restrictions imposed by earlier approaches limited to a single or few mitochondrial and nuclear markers, to employ genome-wide genotyping and resequencing protocols. These studies have shown hybridisation within the various species complexes, identified regions under selection in agricultural environments, and enable monitoring of genes important as biosecurity risks through introgression into established populations free of the genes. In all cases studied, global trade has emerged as the probable cause of insect spread, making it ever more important that biosecurity protocols and agencies work with researchers to make the most effective use of emerging genomic resources and tools.},

If left unchecked, specialized parasitic Escovopsis fungi can overrun the fungus garden and lead to colony collapse. We report that Escovopsis upregulates the production of two specialized metabolites when it infects the cultivar. These compounds inhibit Pseudonocardia and one, shearinine D, also reduces worker behavioral defenses and is ultimately lethal when it accumulates in ant tissues. Our results are consistent with an active evolutionary arms race between Pseudonocardia and Escovopsis, which modifies both bacterial and behavioral defenses such that colony collapse is unavoidable once Escovopsis infections escalate.},

	abstract = {Assassin or robber flies (Asilidae) and bee flies (Bombyliidae) are two of the largest and most diverse fly families with over 7400 and 4700 described species worldwide, respectively. Adult assassin flies are predatory, feeding on smaller insects captured on the wing, and larvae predate on soft-bodied arthropods in the soil or rotting wood. Adult bee flies feed on nectar and pollen. Almost all bee fly larvae are external or internal parasitoids of other insect larvae, usually in the soil. Although the interaction between bee fly larvae and their hosts has been rarely observed, we recently discovered assassin fly larvae hosting bee fly Lepidanthrax linguatus (Anthracinae: Villini) endoparasitoids in riverine sandy soil in southern NSW, Australia. While bee fly larvae have been known to attack other fly larvae, Asilidae is an uncommon host group. Furthermore, to find bee fly larvae inside the host is even less common because most bee fly larvae are ectoparasitoids. Here we describe and illustrate the host assassin fly (Bathypogon nigrinus: Bathypogoninae) larva and pupa, as well as the first instar bee fly larva (planidium) though careful external examination of the surface of the asilid larva, which is translucent, allowing us to see the internal parasite. This is the first larva and pupa from Bathypogoninae to be described. We also illustrate the bee fly larva in detail based on scanning electron microscopy of a larva in situ, after dissection from the host. Finally, we describe the late instar larval and pupal exuvia of the endoparasitoid. Like other endoparasitoid bombyliid larvae in the Villini, the first instar larva causes the host to produce a breathing tube that surrounds the posterior half of the parasitoid, allowing the parasitoid to maintain contact with atmospheric oxygen.},

A few of the commentators questioned our definition of ultrasociality, and we begin our response with an elaboration of that definition and a defense of our argument that human ultrasociality began with agriculture. We then respond to the second major area of controversy, namely, our use of group selection to explain the economic drivers behind the agricultural transition. We then focus on the issue of human intentionality raised by the phenomenon of collective intelligence. The intriguing question is to what extent can an entire culture change its own destiny? We then address the issue of the division of labor raised by a number of commentators. The complex division of labor was both a driver and a defining characteristic of ultrasociality, even though it was present in simpler forms in earlier societies. The remaining issues addressed include energy and complexity, expansion and sustainability, and the accelerating evolution of human ultrasociality. These were raised by only a few commentators, but their importance warrants further elaboration.},

	abstract = {Territory size in social insects depends on the rules by which border conflicts are resolved. We present three mechanistic mathematical models of conflict, inspired by the behavior of the pavement ant Tetramorium immigrans, to predict the advantage of larger colonies in pairwise contests and the resulting scaling of territory size with worker force. The models track the number of ants in the nest traveling to and from the boundary or engaged at the boundary. Ants at the boundary base their recruitment response on the relative numbers of ants from the two colonies. With two colonies, our central result is that the larger colony gains a territory disproportionately larger than the ratio of worker forces would indicate. This disproportionate territory control determines the scaling relation of territory size with worker force in a population. In two dimensions, if territory size were proportional to worker force, the slope of the scaling relation between log territory size and log worker force would be 1.0. With disproportionate territories, this slope is larger and can be explicitly approximated in terms of model parameters, and it is steepest when colonies are packed close to each other, when ants run quickly, or when colonies are small. A steeper slope exaggerates the advantage of larger colonies, creating a positive feedback that could amplify the inequality of the worker force distribution.},

	abstract = {According to the inclusive fitness theory, some degree of positive relatedness is required for the evolution and maintenance of altruism. However, ant colonies are sometimes large interconnected networks of nests, which are genetically homogenous entities, causing a putative problem for the theory. We studied spatial structure and genetic relatedness in two supercolonies of the ant Formica exsecta, using nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We show that there may be multiple pathways to supercolonial social organization leading to different spatial genetic structures. One supercolony formed a genetically homogenous population dominated by a single mtDNA haplotype, as expected if founded by a small number of colonizers, followed by nest propagation by budding and domination of the habitat patch. The other supercolony had several haplotypes, and the spatial genetic structure was a mosaic of nuclear and mitochondrial clusters. Genetic diversity probably originated from long-range dispersal, and the mosaic population structure is likely a result of stochastic short-range dispersal of individuals. Such a mosaic spatial structure is apparently discordant with the current knowledge about the integrity of ant colonies. Relatedness was low in both populations when estimated among nestmates, but increased significantly when estimated among individuals sharing the same genetic cluster or haplogroup. The latter association indicates the important historical role of queen dispersal in the determination of the spatial genetic structure.},

This mode of social organization has been primarily studied in introduced and invasive ant species, so that the recognition ability and genetic structure of ants forming unicolonial populations in their native range remain poorly known. We investigated the pattern of aggression and the genetic structure of six unicolonial populations of the ant Formica paralugubris at four hierarchical levels: within nests, among nests within the same population, among nests of populations within the Alps or Jura Mountains and among nests of the two mountain ranges. Ants within populations showed no aggressive behaviour, but recognized nonnestmates as shown by longer antennation bouts. Overall, the level of aggression increased with geographic and genetic distance but was always considerably lower than between species. No distinct behavioural supercolony boundaries were found. Our study provides evidence that unicoloniality can be maintained in noninvasive ants despite significant genetic differentiation and the ability to discriminate between nestmates and nonnestmates.},

This phenomenon is a ubiquitous and key feature of social groups in nature, as virtually every study conducted to date has documented repeatable between-group differences in collective behavior, and has revealed ongoing selection on these traits in both the laboratory and field environments. Five years ago, foundational reviews by Bengston and Jandt pioneered this topic and delimited the present knowledge on collective personality. Here, we update these reviews by summarizing the recent works conducted in the field’s most prominent model systems: social spiders and eusocial insects. After presenting how these recent works helped scientists to better understand the determinants of collective personality, we used a trait-by-trait format to compare and contrast the results and thematic trends obtained in these taxa on 10 major aspects of collective personality: division of labor, foraging, exploration, boldness, defensive behavior, aggressiveness, decision-making, cognition, learning, and nest construction. We then discuss why similarities and dissimilarities in these results open the door to applying numerous theories developed in evolutionary behavioral ecology for individual traits (e.g., life history theory, game theory, optimal foraging theory) at the colony level, and close by providing examples of unexamined questions in this field that are ripe for new inquiries. We conclude that collective personality, as a framework, has the potential to improve our general understanding of how selection acts on intraspecific variation in collective phenotypes that are of key importance across arthropod societies and beyond.},

In eusocial colonies, group size may have similar effects on colony traits as body size has on organismal traits. Social insects may, therefore, be useful to test theories about general principles of scaling, as they constitute a distinct level of organization. However, there is a surprising lack of data on group sizes in social insects and other group-living arthropods, and multiple confounding factors have to be controlled to detect effects of group size. If such rigorous studies are performed, group size may become as important to understanding collective organization as is body size in explaining behavior and life history of individual organisms.},

	abstract = {In the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood, 1839, the worker caste evolved into two morphologically distinct subcastes: minor workers and soldiers. The evolution of soldiers, which are larger in size than minor workers and have disproportionately larger heads, are thought to be key to Phediole’s success. Although many studies have focused on external anatomy, little is known about their internal anatomy. We therefore used microCT imaging and quantitative three-dimensional image analysis to reconstruct the major glands of the head, the musculature, nervous system, and digestive organ of minor workers and soldiers of four Pheidole species. We expected these tissues to scale isometrically and to be proportionally larger in soldiers relative to the minor workers. Surprisingly, we found that the nervous system, cephalic gland, and digestive organ volume are absolutely and relatively smaller in soldiers, whereas muscle volume is absolutely and relatively larger, than in minor workers. This may reflect individual-level trade-offs, where muscles grow at the expense of all other cephalic organs. Alternatively, this relationship may reflect the specialization of internal anatomy in each subcaste to enhance division of labour at the colony level. Future studies should test these alternative hypotheses across a larger number of Pheidole species.},

              ) form collective assemblages out of their own bodies to perform a variety of functions that benefit the entire colony. Here we examine ‟bridges” of linked individuals that are constructed to span gaps in the colony’s foraging trail. How these living structures adjust themselves to varied and changing conditions remains poorly understood. Our field experiments show that the ants continuously modify their bridges, such that these structures lengthen, widen, and change position in response to traffic levels and environmental geometry. Ants initiate bridges where their path deviates from their incoming direction and move the bridges over time to create shortcuts over large gaps. The final position of the structure depended on the intensity of the traffic and the extent of path deviation and was influenced by a cost–benefit trade-off at the colony level, where the benefit of increased foraging trail efficiency was balanced by the cost of removing workers from the foraging pool to form the structure. To examine this trade-off, we quantified the geometric relationship between costs and benefits revealed by our experiments. We then constructed a model to determine the bridge location that maximized foraging rate, which qualitatively matched the observed movement of bridges. Our results highlight how animal self-assemblages can be dynamically modified in response to a group-level cost–benefit trade-off, without any individual unit’s having information on global benefits or costs.},

	abstract = {Collective behavior emerges from local interactions between group members, and natural selection can fine-tune these interactions to achieve different collective outcomes. However, at least in principle, collective behavior can also evolve via changes in group-level parameters. Here, we show that army ant mass raiding, an iconic collective behavior in which many thousands of ants spontaneously leave the nest to go hunting, has evolved from group raiding, in which a scout directs a much smaller group of ants to a specific target. We describe the structure of group raids in the clonal raider ant, a close relative of army ants. We find that the coarse structure of group raids and mass raids is highly conserved, and that army ants and their relatives likely follow similar behavioral rules, despite the fact that their raids differ strikingly in overall appearance. By experimentally increasing colony size in the clonal raider ant, we show that mass raiding gradually emerges from group raiding without altering individual behavioral rules. This suggests a simple mechanism for the evolution of army ant mass raids, and more generally that scaling effects may provide an alternative mechanism for evolutionary transitions in complex collective behavior.},

	abstract = {Complex recognition systems underlie the social organization of many organisms. In social insects the acceptance of other individuals as nestmates can involve a variety of different cues, but the relative importance of these cues can change in relation to the fitness costs of accepting or rejecting other individuals. In this study we investigate the mechanisms that
underlie recognition behaviour in Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). Introduced populations of Argentine ants are characterized by a social structure known as unicoloniality where intraspecific aggression is absent over large distances resulting in the formation of expansive supercolonies. Recent research has identified sites where multiple, mutually aggressive supercolonies co-occur allowing an examination of Argentine ant behaviour at territorial
boundaries. We found that workers from different supercolonies always interact aggressively with one another, but that neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located in the immediate vicinity of territory borders) consistently exhibited higher levels of aggression compared to those displayed by non-neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located far enough away from a territory border so that interactions are unlikely). This difference in the level of aggression
displayed between neighbours and between non-neighbours from different supercolonies cannot be explained by differences in
relatedness or genetic similarity. Instead our findings suggest that direct contact between mutually antagonistic colonies is sufficient to elevate aggression. A laboratory experiment in which we manipulated the extent to which colonies with no
prior history of contact could interact with one another, revealed that aggression increased after colonies were permitted to interact, but dropped after connections between colonies were severed. Moreover, the mere presence of an aggressive supercolony was sufficient to elicit elevated aggression. Overall these patterns are opposite to the “dear enemy” phenomenon and could
be the result of the intense territorial aggression exhibited by established supercolonies of this species.},

	abstract = {Kinship among group members has long been recognized as a main factor promoting the evolution of sociality and reproductive altruism, yet some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological dominance of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox because relatedness between nestmates is effectively zero. Recently, it has been proposed that, in the Argentine ant, unicoloniality is a derived trait that evolved after its introduction into new habitats. Here we test this basic assumption by conducting a detailed genetic analysis of four native and six introduced populations with five to 15 microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial gene. In contrast to the assumption that native populations consist of family-based colonies with related individuals who are aggressive toward members of other colonies, we found that native populations also form supercolonies, and are effectively unicolonial. Moreover, just as in introduced populations, the relatedness between nestmates is not distinguishable from zero in these native range supercolonies. Genetic differentiation between native supercolonies was very high for both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, indicating extremely limited gene flow between supercolonies. The only important difference between the native and introduced populations was that supercolonies were several orders of magnitude smaller in the native range (25-500 m). This size difference has important consequences for our understanding of the evolution and stability of unicolonial structures because the relatively small size of supercolonies in the native range implies that competition can occur between supercolonies, which can act as a break on the spread of selfish mutants by eliminating supercolonies harboring them.},

Here we present regional patterns of intraspecific aggression, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and population genetics of 18 nesting sites across Corsica and the French mainland. Aggression tests confirm the presence of a third European supercolony, the Corsican supercolony, which exhibits moderate to high levels of aggression, depending on nesting sites, with the Main supercolony, and invariably high levels of aggression with the Catalonian supercolony. The chemical analyses corroborated the behavioural data, with workers of the Corsican supercolony showing moderate differences in CHCs compared to workers of the European Main supercolony and strong differences compared to workers of the Catalonian supercolony. Interestingly, there were also clear genetic differences between workers of the Catalonian supercolony and the two other supercolonies at both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, but only very weak genetic differentiation between nesting sites of the Corsican and Main supercolonies (FST = 0.06). A detailed comparison of the genetic composition of supercolonies also revealed that, if one of the last two supercolonies derived from the other, it is the Main supercolony that derived from the Corsican supercolony rather than the reverse. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of conducting more qualitative and quantitative analyses of the level of aggression between supercolonies, which has to be correlated with genetic and chemical data.},

	abstract = {The biological hierarchy of genes, cells, organisms and societies is a fundamental reality in the living world. This hierarchy of entities did not arise ex nihilo at the origin of life, but rather has been serially generated by a succession of critical events known as ‘evolutionary transitions in individuality’ (ETIs). Given the sequential nature of ETIs, it is natural to look for candidates to form the next hierarchical tier. We analyse claims that these candidates are found among ‘supercolonies’, ant populations in which discrete nests cooperate as part of a wider collective, in ways redolent of cells in a multicellular organism. Examining earlier empirical work and new data within the recently proposed ‘Darwinian space’ framework, we offer a novel analysis of the evolutionary status of supercolonies and show how certain key conditions might be satisfied in any future process transforming these collaborative networks into true Darwinian individuals.},

	abstract = {Army ants are dominant social hunters of invertebrates and thereby play an integral role in tropical ecosystems. They are defined by a suite of evolutionarily interrelated physiological, behavioural and morphological traits, the army ant adaptive syndrome: they are obligate group predators, they frequently relocate their nests, and their permanently wingless queens found new colonies accompanied by workers. If this functional definition is applied rather than a taxonomic one, army ants have evolved repeatedly in distantly related groups of ants. In addition, army ants typically have extremely male-biased numerical sex-ratios, and the queens of the studied species are inseminated by many males. The aim of this review is to provide a synthesis of the most recent work on army ant biology, to outline an evolutionary scenario that connects the different aspects of army ant life-history, and to give some directions for future research.},

	abstract = {The scope of adaptive phenotypic change within a lineage is shaped by how functional traits evolve. Castes are defining functional traits of adaptive phenotypic change in complex insect societies, and caste evolution is expected to be phylogenetically conserved and developmentally constrained at broad phylogenetic scales. Yet how castes evolve at the species level has remained largely unaddressed. Turtle ant soldiers (genus Cephalotes), an iconic example of caste specialization, defend nest entrances by using their elaborately armored heads as living barricades. Across species, soldier morphotype determines entrance specialization and defensive strategy, while head size sets the specific size of defended entrances. Our species-level comparative analyses of morphotype and head size evolution reveal that these key ecomorphological traits are extensively reversible, repeatable, and decoupled within soldiers and between soldier and queen castes. Repeated evolutionary gains and losses of the four morphotypes were reconstructed consistently across multiple analyses. In addition, morphotype did not predict mean head size across the three most common morphotypes, and head size distributions overlapped broadly across all morphotypes. Concordantly, multiple model-fitting approaches suggested that soldier head size evolution is best explained by a process of divergent pulses of change. Finally, while soldier and queen head size were broadly coupled across species, the level of head size disparity between castes was decoupled from both queen head size and soldier morphotype. These findings demonstrate that caste evolution can be highly dynamic at the species level, reshaping our understanding of adaptive morphological change in complex social lineages.},

Over the course of 55 years, the Rettenmeyers went on numerous field trips mainly to the Central American tropics and analyzed hundreds of self-collected samples and those sent by a multitude of other scientists, who were inspired by Carl’s enthusiasm. It comes as no surprise that Carl Rettenmeyer became the world’s leading expert on army ant associates. This paper, which the Rettenmeyers nearly completed before Carl’s death in 2009, gives the first comprehensive list of animals known to be found in the company of a single army ant species: Eciton burchellii. The 557 recorded associates range from birds to insects and mites and comprise the largest described animal association centering around one particular species. Although some of these associates may be opportunistic encounters, we are confident that approximately 300 of the recorded species depend on the ants, at least in part, for their existence. The extinction of E. burchellii from any habitat over its vast area of distribution is likely to cause the extinction of numerous associated animals at that site. This overview will hopefully inspire researchers throughout the world to follow in the Rettenmeyers’ footsteps and continue the investigation of army ants and their associates.},

Much of the regulation is based on mass communication, in which information is transmitted from group to group or group to individual rather than from individual to individual. Feedback loops involving mass communication are more precise than individual responses, which often consist of simple ‘rules of thumb’ based on few stimuli. The loops also produce patterns that emerge at the level of the colony and are difficult to predict from a knowledge of individual behavior alone.

	abstract = {The origin of complex worker-caste systems in ants perplexed Darwin1 and has remained an enduring problem for evolutionary and developmental biology2–6. Ants originated approximately 150 million years ago, and produce colonies with winged queen and male castes as well as a wingless worker caste7. In the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole, the wingless worker caste has evolved into two morphologically distinct subcastes—small-headed minor workers and large-headed soldiers8. The wings of queens and males develop from populations of cells in larvae that are called wing imaginal discs7. Although minor workers and soldiers are wingless, vestiges or rudiments of wing imaginal discs appear transiently during soldier development7,9–11. Such rudimentary traits are phylogenetically widespread and are primarily used as evidence of common descent, yet their functional importance remains equivocal1,12–14. Here we show that the growth of rudimentary wing discs is necessary for regulating allometry—disproportionate scaling—between head and body size to generate large-headed soldiers in the genus Pheidole. We also show that Pheidole colonies have evolved the capacity to socially regulate the growth of rudimentary wing discs to control worker subcaste determination, which allows these colonies to maintain the ratio of minor workers to soldiers. Finally, we provide comparative and experimental evidence that suggests that rudimentary wing discs have facilitated the parallel evolution of complex worker-caste systems across the ants. More generally, rudimentary organs may unexpectedly acquire novel regulatory functions during development to facilitate adaptive evolution.},

Female ants display a wide variety of morphological castes, including workers, soldiers, ergatoid (worker-like) queens and queens. Alternative caste development within a species arises from a variable array of genetic and environmental factors. Castes themselves are also variable across species and have been repeatedly gained and lost throughout the evolutionary history of ants. Here, we propose a simple theory of caste development and evolution. We propose that female morphology varies as a function of size, such that larger individuals possess more queen-like traits. Thus, the diverse mechanisms that influence caste development are simply mechanisms that affect size in ants. Each caste-associated trait has a unique relationship with size, producing a phenotypic space that permits some combinations of worker- and queen-like traits, but not others. We propose that castes are gained and lost by modifying the regions of this phenotypic space that are realized within a species. These modifications can result from changing the size–frequency distribution of individuals within a species, or by changing the association of tissue growth and size. We hope this synthesis will help unify the literature on caste in ants, and facilitate the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying caste development and evolution.},

	url = {https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-33219/v1},
	abstract = {Background: The order Hymenoptera has about 117,000 known species of which about 20.000 in the Afrotropical zone. The families covered are ants, bees, and wasps. They belong to the suborder Apocrita, characterized by a constriction between the rst and second abdominal segments. The purpose of the study was to make an overview of how ants, bees and wasps and their products such as honey are utilized, perceived, and experienced in daily life across sub-Saharan Africa.
Method: Ethno-entomological information on ants, bees and wasps in sub-Saharan Africa was collected by: (1) interviews with more than 300 people from about 120 ethnic groups in 27 countries in the region; (2) library studies in Africa, London, Paris and Leiden.
Results : Of the order of the Hymenoptera only queens of the ant Carebara vidua are deliberately eaten. Often unintentionally bee larvae are eaten with honey and sugar ants with sugar. Apart from honey being a food item, it is also widely used to treat numerous medical problems, as a stimulant (for the memory) or as a cosmetic. It is also used in naming or wedding ceremonies. In the Qur’an, the medical value of honey is recognized. Seed stores of ants maybe harvested by humans. In the Sudan bee stings are used to cure arthritis; bee venom having bioactive properties. Wasp nests are used to cure in ammations such as mumps. The properties of certain insects are used to convey these treats to persons it is employed to, such as nasty stinging wasps to make dogs vicious. Some stories seem to make no sense like the snake-trapping ants in Madagascar, but a scienti c explanation is provided. The looks of certain insects may inspire people to construct stories or have proverbs such as the very narrow waste of wasps, suggesting sterility. Bee swarms and driver ants are feared all over and believed to be employed (by witchdoctors) to punish. Not all stories of events with bees or ants are similar across sub-Saharan Africa. These insects, being social, are also used to stimulate cohesion between people.
Conclusion: Ants, bees and wasps in sub-Saharan Africa maybe feared because of their bites and stings. However, the insects or their products are often employed for medical reasons, honey having numerous applications. They are also many stories and believes in which the characteristics of these insects play a role.},

The debate on 'Kosovo' indicates that there is considerable uncertainty about war as a concept. A serious critique on the concept of war has surfaced, and alternative articulations are frequently explored. A broad sphere of non-war has emerged. Within a new constellation, war remains first and foremost a memory from the past. There is the sphere of classic war, which remains based on the modern story of states, sovereignty and territoriality.

The international level explores variables that operate exclusively "above" states such as anarchy and the distribution of power. The domestic level explores variables that operate exclusively within states, such as regime type and bureaucratic design. The individual level explores the ways in which individual psychology (i.e. beliefs, culture, personality) contributes to the outbreak of war.

	abstract = {In recent litigation before U.S. federal courts, the government has argued that military commissions have jurisdiction to prosecute offenses against the “common law of war,” which the government defines as a body of domestic offenses, such as inchoate conspiracy, that violate the American law of war. This Article challenges that definition by arguing that stray references to the term “common law of war” in historical materials meant something completely different. By examining the Lieber Code, the writings of early natural law theorists, and early American judicial decisions, this Article concludes that the “common law of war” referred to a branch of the law of nations that applied during internal armed conflicts, such as civil wars with non-state actors. This body of law was called “common,” not because it was extended or elaborated by the common law method of judge-applied law, but rather because it was “common” to all mankind by virtue of natural law, and thus even applied to internal actors, such as rebel forces, who were not otherwise bound by international law as formal states were. By recapturing this lost definition of the common law of war, this Article casts some doubt on the U.S. government’s position that military commissions have jurisdiction not only over international offenses, but also domestic violations of the law of war.},

	abstract = {The paper examines the justification of warfare. The main thesis is that war is very difficult to justify, and justification by invoking “justice” is not the way to succeed it. Justification and justness (“justice”) are very different venues: while the first attempts to explain the nature of war and offer possible schemes of resolution (through adequate definitions), the second aims to endorse a specific type of warfare as correct and hence allowed – which is the crucial part of “just war theory.” However, “just war theory,” somewhat Manichean in its nature, has very deep flaws. Its final result is criminalization of war, which reduces warfare to police action, and finally implies a very strange proviso that one side has a right to win. All that endangers the distinction between ius ad bellum and ius in bello, and destroys the collective character of warfare (reducing it to an incomprehensible individual level, as if a group of people entered a battle in hopes of finding another group of people willing to respond). Justification of war is actually quite different – it starts from the definition of war as a kind of conflict which cannot be solved peacefully, but for which there is mutual understanding that it cannot remain unresolved. The aim of war is not justice, but peace, i.e. either a new articulation of peace, or a restoration of the status quo ante. Additionally, unlike police actions, the result of war cannot be known or assumed in advance, giving war its main feature: the lack of control over the future. Control over the future, predictability (obtained through laws), is a feature of peace. This might imply that war is a consequence of failed peace, or inability to maintain peace. The explanation of this inability (which could simply be incompetence, or because peace, as a specific articulation of distribution of social power, is not tenable anymore) forms the justification of war. Justice is always an important part of it, but justification cannot be reduced to it. The logic contained here refers to ius ad bellum, while ius in bello is relative to various parameters of sensitivity prevalent in a particular time (and expressed in customary and legal rules of warfare), with the purpose to make warfare more humane and less expensive.},

The theory considers organizations, their populations, and their environments as the interdependent outcome of managerial actions, institutional influences, and extra-institutional changes (technological, sociopolitical, and other environmental phenomena). In particular, the theory incorporates potential differences and equifinal outcomes related to country-specific variation. The basic theses of this paper are that firm strategic and organization adaptations coevolve with changes in the environment (competitive dynamics, technological, and institutional) and organization population and forms, and that new organizational forms can mutate and emerge from the existing population of organizations. The theory has guided a multicountry research collaboration on strategic and organization adaptations and the mutation and emergence of new organizational forms from within the existing population of organizations.},

	abstract = {Movements develop in coevolution with regimes and other actors in their environments. Movement trajectories evolve through stochastic processes and are constrained, but not determined, by structures. Coevolution provides a theoretical structure for organizing existing understandings of social movements and sharpening future research. Stochastic thinking is essential for recognizing the both the volatility and path dependence of collective action and its underlying structural constraints. Formal models of diffusion, adaptive learning, mutual reinforcement, and inter-actor competition are developed and compared with empirical protest series. Responses to exogenous reinforcement, mutual adaptation in which failure is as important as success, and inter-actor competition are the most plausible mechanisms to account for empirical patterns. Trajectories of action depend upon the number of discrete random actors. Overall, the analysis suggests that movement dynamics are shaped more by interactions with other actors than by processes internal to a movement, and that empirical analysis must be sensitive to the level of aggregation of the data. This article advances two arguments. First, that coevolution can provide a theoretical structure for organizing existing understandings of social movements and sharpening future research.},

The intersection of the two—which we term “parochial altruism”—is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain by eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts. Our game-theoretic analysis and agent-based simulations show that under conditions likely to have been experienced by late Pleistocene and early Holocene humans, neither parochialism nor altruism would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict, they could have evolved jointly.},

Because the immense private costs borne by individual warriors create benefits that are shared widely by others in their group, warfare is a stark evolutionary puzzle that is difficult to explain.

Though parasitism in general is known to be of crucial importance in the evolution of host species, social parasites, though intriguing, are often considered as a phenomenon of marginal interest and are typically not taken into account in reviews on parasitism. Nevertheless, social parasites are rather common in social bees, wasps, and ants and therefore may offer unique model systems to study a number of fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. Here we review several aspects of the peculiar life history of slave-making ants, which is characterized by socially parasitic founding of colonies and the pillage of broods from neighboring host colonies during slave raids. In particular we focus on the evolution of slave-making habits (dulosis), communication mechanisms between slave makers and their hosts, sex-allocation ratios and reproductive conflict, and the effect of slave makers on host populations.},

The origin of slaves found in colonies of the obligate slavemaker was examined with nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers to make inferences about the frequency and severity of slave raids. Relatedness of enslaved L. longispinosus workers in the same nest was very low, and our data suggest that, on average, each slavemaker nest raids six host colonies per season. Therefore, the influence of slavemaker species on their hosts is much stronger than simple numerical ratios suggest. We also found that slave relatedness was higher in small than in large slavemaker nests; thus, larger nests wield a much stronger influence on the host. We estimated that in the study population, on average, a host nest has a 50\% chance of being attacked by a slavemaker colony per year. Free-living Leptothorax colonies in the vicinity of slavemaker nests did not represent the source of slaves working in P. americanus colonies, which suggests that raided nests either do not survive or migrate after being raided. Colony composition and intranest relatedness of free-living L. longispinosus colonies differed markedly between areas with slavemakers and those that are parasite-free. In the presence of slavemakers, host colonies were less likely to be polygynous and had fewer workers and a higher relatedness among worker brood. Host nests with slavemaker neighbors allocated more resources into sexuals, possibly caused by these shifts in nest demography. Finally, enslaved Leptothorax workers in P. americanus nests appeared to be less efficient than their counterparts in free-living colonies. Thus, slavemakers exert a much stronger impact on their hosts than had previously been suspected and represent an unique system to study parasite-host coevolution.},

However, empirical studies of the highly analogous social parasites, which use the workers of another eusocial species to raise their own young, have never explicitly examined the dynamics of these systems from a coevolutionary perspective. Here, we demonstrate interpopulational variation in behavioural interactions between a socially parasitic slave-maker ant and its host that is consistent with the expectations of host-parasite coevolution. Parasite pressure, as inferred by the size, abundance and raiding frequency of Protomognathus americanus colonies, was highest in a New York population of the host Leptothorax longispinosus and lowest in a West Virginia population. As host-parasite coevolutionary theory would predict, we found that the slave-makers and the hosts from New York were more effective at raiding and defending against raiders, respectively, than were conspecifics from the West Virginia population. Some of these variations in efficacy were brought about by apparently simple shifts in behaviour. These results demonstrate that defence mechanisms against social parasites can evolve, and they give the first indications of the existence of a coevolutionary arms race between a social parasite and its host.},

This focus distracts from the main questions of interest in current research, which require an understanding of how individuals interact with each other and their environments.

Analyses were focused on three major axes of soldier morphological diversification: discrete morphotype, head size, and head-size range (i.e., soldier polymorphism). The analyses showed that while all species use some entrances small enough to fit the head of one soldier, specialization on entrances that tightly fit the head of one soldier was only seen in species with the most specialized soldier morphotype. They also showed that the degree of soldier polymorphism was only positively correlated with the typical range of entrances in species with the most specialized morphotype. Overall, these findings indicated that a tight 1:1 size-matching between available soldier head sizes and selected entrance sizes is limited to species with the most specialized soldier morphotype, while species with less specialized morphotypes use a broader range of larger entrances. Together, these findings suggest a new general hypothesis for the adaptive diversification of caste systems: major shifts in ecological specialization drive the evolution of novel caste morphotypes, while minor expansions and contractions of an existing resource range shape the evolution of the size distribution of an existing caste. Broadly, these findings highlight the possibility for complex coupling and decoupling between different axes of caste diversification in lineages with complex social phenotypes.},

	abstract = {The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity. Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly. Residual lifespan increased by 57 \% when colonies were penned for 20 days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory. Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population size declined when mortality exceeded 4 \% per day. Experimental increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks, opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger workers.},

Here, we make use of the unusual biology and experimental amenability of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi to jointly quantify the behavioral and physiological responses of workers to a social signal emitted by larvae. Using automated behavioral quantification and oocyte size measurements in colonies of different sizes and with different worker-to-larvae ratios, we show that the workers in a colony respond to larvae by increasing foraging activity and inhibiting ovarian activation in a progressive manner and that these responses are stronger in smaller colonies. This work adds to our knowledge of the processes that link plastic individual behavioral/physiological responses to colony-level phenotypes in social insect colonies.},

I argue instead that the term DOL as understood by most social insect researchers today is descriptive, useful, and carries no such implications of process or links to internal attributes. I suggest that the confusion can be addressed by recognizing the distinction between the ontogenetic causes of DOL, which set individuals’ response thresholds (RT) during their development, and the behavioral and physiological mechanisms that act in the moment to determine TA via distributed processing. I further suggest that the term “specialization” as applied to social insects should be understood to mean simply “to concentrate on,” without requiring that it be accompanied by increased performance efficiency.},

The study of personality differences across individuals within the same behavioral caste may contribute to an understanding of how social insects divide labor within the nest. Here, we define and investigate three dimensions of personality within the worker caste of a model social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, as follows: (1) consistent individual behavioral differences over time, (2) consistent individual behavioral differences across contexts, and (3) the presence of correlated suites of behaviors. To test whether honey bee workers exhibit dimensions 1 and 2, we repeatedly assessed responses of groups of same-age bees in cages to stimuli that are relevant to bee life history. To test for dimension 3, we examined behavior within a colony context by using observation hives to record the behaviors of individual bees across their lifetimes. Our results provide some evidence for all three dimensions of personality in honey bee workers. In particular, our data suggest some individuals may be more likely to be highly interactive with other workers (e.g., engaging in food sharing), while other individuals are consistently less interactive. These findings expand upon and contribute to previous models for the organization of worker division of labor in honey bees, suggesting that consistent behavioral differences (personalities) of workers within a behavioral caste have the potential to contribute to subcaste division of labor.},

	abstract = {Animals may face a tradeoff between enhanced cognitive ability and the cost of maintaining larger and more energetically expensive brains. In social species, this tradeoff could be influenced by energy-reducing benefits of cooperation and collective cognition. Greater social complexity in ants is hypothesized to be associated with smaller brain size, a pattern opposite that found in some social vertebrates. Ants vary in worker and colony size, and worker size-frequency distributions; larger workers have larger, more costly, brains. Colony-level foraging performance and its energetic consequence to fitness depend on individual cognitive capabilities as well as collective behaviors. To explore the impact of diet, behavioral ability, and social organization on brain evolution, we developed a model incorporating food availability, foraging behavior and related energetic gain, colony size, worker size and polymorphism, and brain size. Colonies could increase energy intake through foraging performance by increasing worker size, and by correlation, brain size and expanded task capability, or by increasing colony size and collective foraging. Results show that resource-poor environments favored small colonies of relatively large-bodied and thus large-brained pluripotent workers that had higher energetic costs. In contrast, large colonies of relatively small-bodied and small-brained workers in resource-rich environments harvested food with lower brain investment and hence decreased metabolic costs. Worker size-related behavioral specialization and covarying brain investment also influenced fitness. The energetic advantage of polymorphism depended on the degree of association of the navigational abilities employed during foraging and worker brain size. Our study suggests that diet, colony size, and worker size may influence tradeoffs between individual and collective cognition and the evolution of brain size and division of labor in eusocial insects such as ants.},

	abstract = {Group size has profound effects on the organization of work. In the social insects, larger colony size is consistently associated with lower mass-specific energy use; similar hypometric relationships between group size and per-gram energy use may extend across other social taxa. The specific mechanisms driving social metabolic scaling vary among species, but evidence suggests that it can be associated with organizational changes in work (task) performance that allow more efficient energy use by larger groups. In social insect colonies, larger group size allows stronger individual specialization, greater diversity in task performance, and likely gives improved resilience to stochastic events. Larger colonies often also allocate a larger proportion of workers to maintenance and reserve rather than to foraging and brood care tasks, potentially reducing costs. For the few species examined, these organizational changes seem to be associated with lower mean but higher variance in movement rates, providing a concrete connection to metabolic use. Interestingly, colony group size is not generally associated with changes in the proportional number of colony workers resting versus doing work, but this may vary across social systems. Colonies with hypometric metabolic scaling tend to show constant or greater efficiency of brood production, consistent with efficiency rather than constraint-based scaling models. These patterns of work and energetics in social groups show distinct parallels with organismal scaling. Investigation into social metabolic scaling could contribute to identifying unifying scaling theories for the disparate fields of animal behavior, physiology, and human sociology.},

Here, we explore the regulatory genomics of DOL in honey bees using RNA-Seq between nurses and foragers for eight tissues. We begin to test the hypothesis that caste-specific gene expression may be controlled in a manner analogous to how sex-specific gene expression is controlled. Specifically, we look for candidate master caste regulators that could play a role in controlling caste-specific gene expression analogous to the role played by double sex in sex-specific gene expression. We make significant first steps towards testing this hypothesis by showing that only a small number of regulatory genes show widespread differential expression across many tissues and are thus candidates for genes that could coordinate widespread patterns of gene expression in response to endocrine signals responsive to social needs. Two strong candidates are kruppel homolog-1 and double sex. Double sex, in particular, has previously been associated with sex linked phenotypic plasticity in other insects and is a promising candidate for future work. In addition to testing this primary hypothesis, we also show that the control of DOL has a complex genetic basis such that the same regulatory genes are used repeatedly in different tissues at the same caste transition in an independent manner. We further show that most regulatory genes only show differential expression in a single tissue. Overall, this study suggests candidate genes for the key regulators of social behavior in honey bees.},

Because social networks mirror the dual nature of division of labor by representing the individual in the connected web of the society, they are ideally suited to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings that organize social life and drive division of labor. Network analyses provide a panoply of tools that help shed light on the functional role of network structure, and that, if carefully used and combined with well-designed experiments, can revolutionize our comprehension of the distributed regulation of work in social insects. Here, I summarize the emergent nature of division of labor, lay out caveats of social network analysis and then discuss how a selection of network measures can dissect individual level and colony level connectivity to enhance our understanding of division of labor, and provide a more integrated view of how insect societies function.},

	abstract = {Task allocation in social insect colonies is generally organised into an age-related division of labour, termed the temporal polyethism schedule, which may in part have evolved to reduce infection of the colony’s brood by pests and pathogens. The temporal polyethism schedule is sensitive to colony perturbations that may lead to adaptive changes in task allocation, maintaining colony homeostasis. Though social insects can be infected by a range of parasites, little is known of how these parasites impact within-colony behaviour and the temporal polyethism schedule. We use honey bees (Apis mellifera) experimentally infected by two of their emerging pathogens, Deformed wing virus (DWV), which is relatively understudied concerning its behavioural impact on its host, and the exotic microsporidian Nosema ceranae. We examined parasite effects on host temporal polyethism and patterns of activity within the colony. We found that pathogens accelerated the temporal polyethism schedule, but without reducing host behavioural repertoire. Infected hosts exhibited increased hyperactivity, allocating more time to self-grooming and foraging-related tasks. The strength of behavioural alterations we observed was found to be pathogen specific; behavioural modifications were more pronounced in virus-treated hosts versus N. ceranae-treated hosts, with potential benefits for the colony in terms of reducing within-colony transmission. Investigating the effects of multiple pathogens on behavioural patterns of social insects could play a crucial role in understanding pathogen spread within a colony and their effects on colony social organisation.},

	abstract = {This 1996 Times Literary Supplement essay examines two very different books about aspects of warfare. Robert O'Connell's Ride of the Second Horseman is a speculative history of the rise of warfare among human beings, looking back to early human beings. It is a striking account, even though speculative, because it deals in early human behavior without offering an explanation from evolutionary biology. O'Connell acknowledges that non-human species can engage in warfare, and specifically notes ants. In that process, he carefully distinguishes - as few writers do - between aggression, violence, weapons use, predation, and war. His conclusion is that although both ants and humans engage in warfare, and although ants do so as a genetic adaptation, war among human beings is a cultural adaptation (and a late one at that) to ecological conditions of resource scarcity. He offers an account of the rise of war based around the domestication of plants and animals, and the tempting targets for raiders of the fruits of agriculture - really taking off into warfare with the domestication of the horse, on the one hand, and the development of the walled city, on the other. Siege warfare, war against the walled city, is therefore the most ancient form of warfare - and, then as today, the most brutal and unsparing of noncombatants. Shawn Roberts considers the threat posed by landmines especially in civil wars, and the way in which they create long term problems for peace and reconstruction.},

A central  finding is that intra-colony violence is heritable, though not prevalent. Results from our simulations reveal specific conditions in which such infrequent forms of violence occur and can be inherited, which in turn helps us understand why Atta cephalotes may persist killing colony members, even though it dampens colony carrying capacity. We also discuss the concerns and implications of our work for modeling conflict and violence more broadly, which in turn raises questions about the ontological nature of the computational and evolutionary models.},

In staged intraspecific interactions in the field between adjacent nests, ants were reluctant to fight on unmarked land and often retreated onto established marked trails, retreated to the nest entrance which they then capped or guarded, or immediately began marking the battle site with Dufour's gland secretion. These results indicate that the territorial behaviour ofA.laevigatais part of a complex system to defend resources, where the defence of one resource (food) can develop into the defence of another (the nest). During the build-up of a war, once individuals from two nests met, recruitment changed from medium and large ants to mainly small ants. It is suggested thatA.laevigatauses the soldier caste to defend the nest against large organisms and recruits numerous small ants in response to conspecific and interspecific ant threats following the square law.},

In societies of bees, ants, and wasps, policing against the production of males by other workers is expected when egg laying by workers decreases the average inclusive fitness of individual group members. This may result (i) from the relatedness of workers being lower to workerthan to queen-derived males or (ii) from a lowered overall colony efficiency. Whereas good evidence exists for policing behavior caused by genetic conflicts, policing caused by efficiency factors has not been demonstrated. We investigated the regulation of reproduction in the ant Platythyrea punctata, a species in which colonies are clones because workers are capable of producing female offspring by thelytokous parthenogenesis. Reproductive conflicts resulting from differences in genetic relatedness are therefore not expected, but uncontrolled reproduction by all workers could lead to the destruction of sociality. Here we show that worker policing by aggressive attacks against additionally reproducing workers keeps the number of reproducing workers low. Furthermore, through experimental manipulation of the number of brood items per colony, we show that worker policing can enhance group efficiency.},

This paper presents a series of field experiments designed to reveal how boundaries are established and how space is divided during contests between colonies that differ in worker population. In battles staged at territory edges, ants from the colony with the greater local density of workers were more likely to recruit nestmates and were more likely to retain control of the contested area. The decision to attack or to withdraw depended upon the relative number of nestmates and intruders. Experimental manipulation of bridges leading to baited platforms showed that prior owners were more likely to win contests, due to strong recruitment by the first ants to discover new regions. On a larger scale, when colony strength was lowered by removal of nests and by application of pesticides, weakened colonies lost more territory to their neighbours than did size-matched controls. These results show that the outcome of boundary disputes depends upon asymmetries in strength between adjacent residents.},

	abstract = {An organism’s foraging range depends on the behavior of neighbors, the dynamics of resources, and the availability of information. We use a well-studied population of the red harvester ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus to develop and independently parameterize models that include these three factors. The models solve for an allocation of foraging ants in the area around the nest in response to other colonies. We compare formulations that optimize at the colony or individual level and those that do or do not include costs of conﬂict. Model predictions were compared with data collected on ant time budgets and ant density. The strategy that optimizes at the colony level but neglects costs of conﬂict predicts unrealistic levels of overlap. In contrast, the strategy that optimizes at the individual level predicts realistic foraging ranges with or without inclusion of conﬂict costs. Both the individual model and the colony model that includes conﬂict costs show good quantitative agreement with data. Thus, an optimal foraging response to a combination of exploitation and interference competition can largely explain how individual foraging behavior creates the foraging range of a colony. Deviations between model predictions and data indicate that colonies might allocate a larger than optimal number of foragers to areas near boundaries between foraging ranges.},

Here, we report a previously undescribed rescue behavior for weaver ants, and determine the role of distance and group membership in residents’ decisions to either rescue or attack conspecifics in distress. First, we tested if residents preferentially rescued nestmates and attacked non-nestmates. Our results show that rescue was more likely for nestmates; however, surprisingly, conspecifics from neighboring colonies were rescued in 43\% of the distress trials. Furthermore, attacks became more frequent as distance between colonies increased showing a dear enemy effect, which may be explained by familiarity, odor recognition, and/or relatedness. Our work exploring the factors that influence the decision to rescue or attack provides novel evidence to understand the underlying selective pressures that shape decisions of cooperation or conflict in highly cooperative societies.},

	abstract = {Non-injurious, collective ritualized displays may have evolved in some species of ants as a means of resolving contests for key resources, without causing a drain in worker numbers through injury. Colonies of the Australian meat ant, Iridomyrmex purpureus, deploy numerous workers to engage in collective displays, which are widely understood to be involved in maintaining exclusive territories. A combination of field surveys and behavioral assays revealed that display grounds do not delimit borders that define exclusive territories. Rather, the proportion of workers from a focal colony found in a quadrat declines monotonically with distance from the nest. In addition, we documented collective displays around food trees, where workers congregated in greater densities and engaged in more aggressive behavior. These results refute the assumption that colonies of I. purpureus establish territorial boundaries by collective displays. Rather these collective displays may be related to the defense of specific resources, including food trees and nest sites. The difference in the level of aggression among displaying workers at different locations may reflect a balance between the benefits of defending a particular resource and an unappreciated cost of escalation.},

We therefore analysed the behavioural response towards open wounds on the social and individual level in the termite group-hunting ant Megaponera analis. During termite raids, some ants get injured by termite soldiers (biting off extremities), after the fight injured ants get carried back to the nest by nest-mates. We observed treatment of the injury by nest-mates inside the nest through intense allogrooming at the wound. Lack of treatment increased mortality from 10\% to 80\% within 24 h, most likely due to infections. Wound clotting occurred extraordinarily fast in untreated injured individuals, within 10 min. Furthermore, heavily injured ants (loss of five extremities) were not rescued or treated; this was regulated not by the helper but by the unresponsiveness of the injured ant. Interestingly, lightly injured ants behaved ‘more injured’ near nest-mates. We show organized social wound treatment in insects through a multifaceted help system focused on injured individuals. This was not only limited to selective rescuing of lightly injured individuals by carrying them back (thus reducing predation risk), but, moreover, included a differentiated treatment inside the nest.},

Recent research on the establishment of colonies in several non-dulotic, intra-specifically territorial ants provides support for and an extension of the territorial hypothesis as a general explanation for dulosis. Several ant species, regardless of dulotic tendencies, have clumped starting nests; adult colonies, nonetheless, are territorial, suggesting that, from each clump, at most a single adult colony will prevail. Territoriality among these starting colonies takes the form of reciprocal brood raiding ("intraspecific slavery" in the sense of Holldobler 1976a); colonies with the most workers, including those acquired from brood raiding, prevail. Truly dulotic species have polydomous hosts; that is, a single colony occupies several nests. Such polydomous host colonies represent a renewable resource that likely permits specialization in their procurement without resource depletion, that is, the evolution of obligate dulosis.},

When parasites manage to circumvent host detection, exploitation of host resources is facilitated, as host defenses have not to be counteracted. Social parasites exploit animal societies and, likewise, detection avoidance can be beneficial. Yet, due to strong selection pressures, hosts of socially parasitic slavemaking ants often recognize them as enemies, so that slavemakers use open force to raid host colonies. These fights, however, prohibit the enslavement of adult host workers (eudulosis), which cannot be manipulated to work for them. Instead, they steal brood during raids, and enslave those upon emergence. In contrast to the violent raids of most slavemakers, no aggression occurs during most of the raids of the newly described slavemaker Temnothorax pilagens. Thereby, T. pilagens regularly induces adult host workers to be part of their slave workforce. We demonstrate that non-enslaved colonies of its host species respond to this slavemaker with little aggression. We further investigate how the slavemaker circumvents recognition and show that chemical resemblance of host profiles might explain the low aggressive responses. But, which parameters determine whether slave raids escalate, resulting in carnage among defenders? Our experiments reveal that host aggression is counterproductive as aggressive host colonies suffer from more fatalities during raids, but cannot save more brood. The slavemaker, however, benefits from not eliciting fights, as it doubles its enslaved workforce by capturing brood plus adult host workers. Hence, undercutting recognition allows the slavemaker to avoid raid escalation with its associated fitness benefits.},

	abstract = {Theft of resources is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. An evolutionary arms race between thieves and their victims is expected. Although several studies have documented inter- and intraspecific theft of resources in different taxa, studies that delve into the behaviour of thieves and the factors that influence their behaviour have not been undertaken. In the current study on the primitively eusocial ant Diacamma indicum, we caught brood thieves redhanded: we observed them in the act of stealing brood and examined their behaviour. Thieves were persistent in their attempts despite facing aggression in the victim colony. Experiencing aggression or failure to steal in the previous attempt negatively impacted a thief’s drive to reattempt. To avoid the risks associated with theft, successful thieves exited from victim nests about three times faster than others who were procuring brood from unguarded nests. In a series of experiments examining factors that caused thieves to increase their exit speed, we found that indirect cues of a foreign colony’s presence, such as odour or the presence of foreign ants, did not induce these changes in thieves. Thus, we conclude that these ant thieves only respond to the direct threat posed by aggressive foreign ants. In this comprehensive study using behavioural experiments, we reveal the simple rules of engagement between victims and brood thieves.},

	abstract = {Studying the behavioral and life history transitions from a cooperative, eusocial life history to exploita­ tive social parasitism allows for deciphering the conditions under which changes in behavior and social organization lead to diversification. The Holarctic ant genus Formica is ideally suited for studying the evo­ lution of social parasitism because half of its 178 species are confirmed or suspected social parasites, which includes all three major classes of social parasitism known in ants. However, the life­history transitions associated with the evolution of social parasitism in this genus are largely unexplored. To test compet­ ing hypotheses regarding the origins and evolution of social parasitism, we reconstructed the first global phylogeny of Formica ants and representative formicine outgroups. The genus Formica originated in the Old World during the Oligocene ({\textasciitilde}30 Ma ago) and dispersed multiple times to the New World. Within Formica, the capacity for dependent colony foundation and temporary social parasitism arose once from a facultatively polygynous, independently colony founding ancestor. Within this parasitic clade, dulotic social parasitism evolved once from a facultatively temporary parasitic ancestor that likely practiced colony bud­ ding frequently. Permanent social parasitism evolved twice from temporary social parasitic ancestors that rarely practiced colony budding, demonstrating that obligate social parasitism can originate from different facultative parasitic backgrounds in socially polymorphic organisms. In contrast to inquiline ant species in other genera, the high social parasite diversity in Formica likely originated via allopatric speciation, high­ lighting the diversity of convergent evolutionary trajectories resulting in nearly identical parasitic life history syndromes.},

	abstract = {Ants (Formicidae) represent a taxonomically diverse group of hymenopterans with over 13,000 extant species, the majority of which inject or spray secretions from a venom gland. The evolutionary success of ants is mostly due to their unique eusociality that has permitted them to develop complex collaborative strategies, partly involving their venom secretions, to defend their nest against predators, microbial pathogens, ant competitors, and to hunt prey. Activities of ant venom include paralytic, cytolytic, haemolytic, allergenic, pro-inflammatory, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and pain-producing pharmacologic activities, while non-toxic functions include roles in chemical communication involving trail and sex pheromones, deterrents, and aggregators. While these diverse activities in ant venoms have until now been largely understudied due to the small venom yield from ants, modern analytical and venomic techniques are beginning to reveal the diversity of toxin structure and function. As such, ant venoms are distinct from other venomous animals, not only rich in linear, dimeric and disulfide-bonded peptides and bioactive proteins, but also other volatile and non-volatile compounds such as alkaloids and hydrocarbons. The present review details the unique structures and pharmacologies of known ant venom proteinaceous and alkaloidal toxins and their potential as a source of novel bioinsecticides and therapeutic agents.},

	abstract = {The geographical mosaic theory of coevolution predicts that species interactions vary between locales. Depending on who leads the coevolutionary arms race, the effectivity of parasite attack or host defence strategies will explain parasite prevalence. Here, we compare behaviour and brain transcriptomes of Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers when defending their nest against an invading social parasite, the slavemaking ant Temnothorax americanus. A full-factorial design allowed us to test whether behaviour and gene expression are linked to parasite pressure on host populations or to the ecological success of parasite populations. Albeit host defences had been shown before to covary with local parasite pressure, we found parasite success to be much more important. Our chemical and behavioural analyses revealed that parasites from high prevalence sites carry lower concentrations of recognition cues and are less often attacked by hosts. This link was further supported by gene expression analysis. Our study reveals that host–parasite interactions are strongly influenced by social parasite strategies, so that variation in parasite prevalence is determined by parasite traits rather than the efficacy of host defence. Gene functions associated with parasite success indicated strong neuronal responses in hosts, including long-term changes in gene regulation, indicating an enduring impact of parasites on host behaviour.This article is part of the theme issue ‘The coevolutionary biology of brood parasitism: from mechanism to pattern’.},

Despite the potential mortality costs due to fighting with an aggressive opponent, the prospects of a large bounty can be worth the risk. In this review, we aim to bring together current knowledge on intercolony fighting with a view to better understand the evolution of warfare in bees and identify avenues for future research. A review of literature reveals that at least 60 species of stingless bees are involved in heterospecific conflicts, either as attacking or victim colonies. The threat of invasion has led to the evolution of architectural, behavioural and morphological adaptations, such as narrow entrance tunnels, mud balls to block the entrance, decoy nests that direct invaders away from the brood chamber, fighting swarms, and soldiers that are skilled at immobilising attackers. Little is known about how victim colonies are selected, but a phylogenetically controlled analysis suggests that the notorious robber bee Lestrimelitta preferentially attacks colonies of species with more concentrated honey. Warfare among bees poses many interesting questions, including why species differ so greatly in their response to attacks and how these alternative strategies of obtaining food or new nest sites have evolved.},

They studied ants as an interesting biological phenomenon, with little thought of the possible beneficial or detrimental effects ants could have on human activities (see Wheeler 1910 as an example). When Europeans began colonizing the New World, serious ant problems occurred. The first reports of pest ants came from Spanish and Portuguese officials of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Trinidad, The West Indies, Central America and South America. Leaf-cutting ants were blamed for making agricultural development almost impossible in many areas. These ants, Atta and Acromyrmex species, are undoubtedly the first ants identified as pests and may be considered to have initiated interest and research in applied myrmecology (Mariconi 1970).},

These lead us to a field study to determine if low concentrations of formic acid might be useful in repelling S. invicta. Filter paper discs treated with 1.3\% or 5\% formic acid (v: v) or distilled water (control) were placed on each of the 46 S. invicta mounds and a disturbance was created. For a minute or less there were significantly more defending ants on the control discs than that on the paper discs treated with formic acid. After food was added and for the next 40 min, there were significantly more foraging ants on the control discs compared to the treated discs. At 50 min into the test, the number of foraging ants on the control and 1.3\% formic acid treated discs was similar, but both were significantly higher than that on the 5\% formic acid treated discs. In addition, the active foraging (≥ 10 ants stayed on or around the food) and burying behavior (soil particles were deposited around the food) continued to be inhibited by 5\% formic acid. The potential application and ecological significant of this repellent effect is discussed.},

	abstract = {Predators may eavesdrop on their prey using innate signals of varying nature. In regards to social prey, most of the prey signals are derived from social communication and may therefore be highly complex. The most efficient predators select signals that provide the highest benefits. Here, we showed the use of eusocial prey signals by the termite-raiding ant Odontoponera transversa. O. transversa selected the trail pheromone of termites as kairomone in several species of fungus-growing termites (Termitidae: Macrotermitinae: Odontotermes yunnanensis, Macrotermes yunnanensis, Ancistrotermes dimorphus). The most commonly predated termite, O. yunnanensis, was able to regulate the trail pheromone component ratios during its foraging activity. The ratio of the two trail pheromone compounds was correlated with the number of termites in the foraging party. (3Z)-Dodec-3-en-1-ol (DOE) was the dominant trail pheromone component in the initial foraging stages when fewer termites were present. Once a trail was established, (3Z,6Z)-dodeca-3,6-dien-1-ol (DDE) became the major recruitment component in the trail pheromone and enabled mass recruitment of nest-mates to the food source. Although the ants could perceive both components, they revealed stronger behavioural responses to the recruitment component, DDE, than to the common major component, DOE. In other words, the ants use the trail pheromone information as an indication of suitable prey abundance, and regulate their behavioural responses based on the changing trail pheromone component. The eavesdropping behaviour in ants therefore leads to an arms race between predator and prey where the species specific production of trail pheromones in termites is targeted by predatory ant species.},

This work is mainly motivated by the need to have realistic models to predict the interaction dynamics of invasive species. The two considered species exhibit different fighting strategies. In order to describe the observed battle dynamics, we start by building a chemical model considering the ants and the fighting groups (for instance two ants of a species and one of the other one) as a chemical species. From the chemical equations we deduce a system of differential equations, whose parameters are estimated by minimizing the difference between the experimental data and the model output. We model the fluctuations observed in the experiments by means of a standard Gillespie algorithm. In order to better reproduce the observed behavior, we adopt a spatial agent-based model, in which ants not engaged in fighting groups move randomly (diffusion) among compartments, and the Gillespie algorithm is used to model the reactions inside a compartment.},

	doi = {10.1002/ecm.1245},
	abstract = {Experimental studies assessing the impact of demographic changes on aggression and inter-group competitive outcomes in communities of social species are rare. This gap in our knowledge is important, not only because social species are foundational elements of many terrestrial ecosystems, but because interference competition among social groups often involves decision-like processes influenced by demographic and environmental contexts. In East Africa, the symbiotic ant Crematogaster mimosae is a co-dominant competitor that engages in high-mortality, intra- and interspecific battles for sole possession of host trees. We manipulated worker density on C. mimosae Acacia host trees, and the colony's opportunity to expand onto neighboring trees to identify how these factors influenced colony-level aggression, expansion success, and longer-term survivorship. Worker density on focal trees was increased through translocation of domatia-bearing branches, and was decreased using partial tree fumigations. We examined impacts of density manipulations on aggression and immediate expansion success under two different risk scenarios. We tied focal trees to either an experimentally emptied-tree (low-risk treatment), or to a C. nigriceps-occupied tree (high-risk treatment). Expansion success onto emptied neighbor trees was 100\% for controls and increased-density colonies, but only 50\% for decreased-density colonies, despite the fact that host trees are a limiting resource in this system. Success expanding onto trees occupied by a heterospecific competitor reached 36\%, 40\% and 79\% in decreased, control, and increased-density trees, respectively. Our results show that changes in worker density due to disturbances or inter-group battles have the potential to disrupt competitive hierarchies. Worker density manipulations also affected longer-term colony persistence. Behavioral and genetic data revealed that 12 months after expansions 100\% of the decreased-density colonies, and 25\% of control and increased-density colonies, had been supplanted by neighboring opportunistic conspecifics. Intraspecific aggression may have lower costs in C. mimosae because aggressive colonies can incorporate workers or queens from defeated competitors. The unexpectedly high frequency of conflicts between conspecific C. mimosae, in combination with behaviors decreasing the cost of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific conflict, may create opportunities for the survival of subordinate competitors in this ant-plant system.

Host choice is an important first step in this process, but the principles guiding host choice are unresolved, especially for specialist parasites choosing among individual hosts with multiple traits. To determine how parasites weigh various host traits relative to others, we need to identify their costs and benefits. Here I use the slave-making ant, Temnothorax americanus, to investigate the payoffs from different host trait combinations. I measured the costs and benefits of raids at hosts that varied in their value (\# brood), defensive power (\# workers), or their ratios. Additionally, I investigated whether slave-maker fighting power influences which host trait combinations were optimal. Slave-makers performed best when hosts contained more brood but fewer workers. However, the ability to maximize this ratio is constrained by the correlation of brood and worker numbers in natural nests, making the optimal host moderately sized. Measures of costs reinforce this conclusion, since slave-maker mortality increased with the number of host workers. Additionally, I found that larger slave-maker colonies have higher payoffs at larger hosts, suggesting their optimal host trait profile differs from smaller colonies. This study shows that social parasites exercising force ought to balance a trade-off between host value and defensibility, rather than maximizing only value. Furthermore, the results highlight that host demography could play a larger role in insect social parasite arms races than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {Ant raiding, the process of identifying and returning food to the nest or bivouac, is a fascinating example of collective motion in nature. During such raids ants lay pheromones to form trails for others to find a food source. In this work a coupled PDE/ODE model is introduced to study ant dynamics and pheromone concentration. The key idea is the introduction of two forms of ant dynamics: foraging and returning, each governed by different environmental and social cues. The model accounts for all aspects of the raiding cycle including local collisional interactions, the laying of pheromone along a trail, and the transition from one class of ants to another. Through analysis of an order parameter measuring the orientational order in the system, the model shows self-organization into a collective state consisting of lanes of ants moving in opposite directions as well as the transition back to the individual state once the food source is depleted matching prior experimental results. This indicates that in the absence of direct communication ants naturally form an efficient method for transporting food to the nest/bivouac.

The same editors believed that the interest in the affairs of honor was shown especially by those individuals who lack honor. Their assertions were reinforced by the fact that many of those who “went out on the site” to solve a “matter of honor” did everything possible to avoid a real confrontation.

	abstract = {Workers from colonies of Pheidole longispinosa (Forel, 1891) in primary forests of Ranomafana National Park in the Fianarantsoa province of Madagascar engaged in periodical predatory raids against neighboring nests of rival ants, most prevalently Pheidole oswaldi (Forel, 1891) and Paraparatrechina glabra (Emery, 1914). Pheidole longispinosa workers engaged in sporadic “hit and run” attacks against foraging lines of enemy ants, preying upon workers as they returned to their respective nests, as well as organized raids on nest entrances. These raids also targeted wood dwelling termite nests. Behavioral observations were made over a 14-day period, with both daylight and nocturnal observations occurring. P. longispinosa was active only during the day, and preyed upon P. glabra regularly, with consistent raids of their foraging columns, and by surprising workers leaving nest entrances. Predation of P. oswaldi only occurred while defending from raids, or from carrying out raids of their own. Individual termites were attacked on sight, and their nest was sporadically raided. Data were taken on types and numbers of prey consumed by P. longispinosa. Behavioral observations of predation, aggression, and communication were also taken. Behaviors such as worker rescue and group hunting were observed. Detailed notes on worker activity were maintained over a 14-day period. P. longispinosa exhibited a local dominance of the invertebrate fauna in the area surrounding their nest. Throughout the observation periods, conflicts with neighboring P. oswaldi were commonplace, with P. longisposa carrying out raids, consuming workers of neighboring ant species.},

We describe agent-based models of inter-group ﬁghts in ants and show that two behavioral mechanisms that are rarely quantiﬁed have large eﬀects on the dynamics of intraspeciﬁc battles; speciﬁcally, the pattern of search by unengaged ants, and assessment of relative numbers. In the absence of assessment, recruitment by both colonies rises to steady averages. Alternatively, if ants tend to lay trails only when they detect that their nestmates outnumber opponents, ﬁghts can be rapidly resolved as one colony ceases recruiting. If ants tend to lay trails when their nestmates are locally outnumbered, the position of the battle may oscillate. We show that the collective ability of ﬁghting ants to accurately compare group sizes may be high even if each ant has limited perception and memory. However, ampliﬁcation of small initial numerical advantages can lead to priority eﬀects favoring the ﬁrst colony to recruit even if it is the smaller colony.},

	abstract = {Mature colonies of Atta leaf-cutting ants are dominant herbivores throughout the Neotropics. Although young colonies have natural enemies, mature colonies, which live in extensive nests containing millions of workers, currently have no recognised predators. New World army ants (Ecitoninae) are specialist social predators of other ants, and the army ant Nomamyrmex esenbeckii, a primarily subterranean species, is known to prey upon young Atta colonies. Here we present the results of the first long-term study of the predator-prey interaction between N. esenbeckii and Atta. Our study establishes the army ant N. esenbeckii as the only known predator capable of successfully attacking and killing mature as well as young colonies of Atta leaf-cutting ants. In natural raids, and experimental tests, Atta rapidly recruited their largest workers (majors) as a specific defensive response to N. esenbeckii raiders and both taxa used their largest individuals in the frontline of battles. The deployment and behaviour of these large workers demonstrates a size-related division of labour and agrees with the predictions of Lanchesters Linear Law of Combat. Both taxa also used cooperative combat teams to overwhelm large combatants from the other side. The success of N. esenbeckii raids varied greatly, such that they were prevented from entering Atta nests in the least successful raids, and completely overran Atta colonies in the most successful raids. The speed and magnitude of the defensive response of mature Atta colonies was key in determining the level of success of N. esenbeckii raids.},

He developed a lifelong passion for myrmecology in his childhood, but chose medicine and neuropsychiatry to earn his living. He first undertook a comparative study of the thalamus under Theodor Meynert in Vienna and then, from 1872 to 1879, he worked as Assistant Physician to Bernhard von Gudden in Munich. This led in 1877 to his seminal work on the organization of the tegmental region in which he provides the first description of the zona incerta and the so-called H (Haubenfeld) fields that still bear his name. In 1879, Forel was appointed Professor of Psychiatry in Munich and Director of the Burghölzli cantonal asylum. He became interested in the therapeutic value of hypnotism, while continuing his work on brain anatomy and ants. His neuroanatomical studies with Gudden’s method led him to formulate the neuron theory in 1887, four years before Wilhelm von Waldeyer, who received most of the credit for it. Forel then definitively turned his back on neuroscience. After his retirement from the Burghölzli asylum in 1898, and despite a stroke in 1911 that left him hemiplegic, Forel started to write extensively on various social issues, such as alcohol abstinence and sexual problems. Before his death in 1931 at the age of 83, Forel published a remarkable book on the social world of the ants in which he made insightful observations on the neural control of sensory and instinctive behavior common to both humans and insects.},

	abstract = {Ants are among the most damaging invasive species, and their success frequently arises from the widespread cooperation displayed by introduced populations, often across hundreds of kilometers. Previous studies of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) have shown that introduced populations on different continents each contain a single, vast supercolony and, occasionally, smaller secondary colonies. Here, we perform inter-continental behavioral analyses among supercolonies in North America, Europe, Asia, Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia and show that these far-flung supercolonies also recognize and accept each other as if members of a single, globally distributed supercolony. Furthermore, populations also possess similar genetic and chemical profiles. However, these ants do show aggression toward ants from South Africa and the smaller secondary colonies that occur in Hawaii and California. Thus, the largest and most dominant introduced populations are likely descended from the same ancestral colony and, despite having been established more than 100 years ago, have diverged very little. This apparent evolutionary stasis is surprising because, in other species, some of the most rapid rates of evolutionary change have occurred in introduced populations. Given the spatial extent of the Argentine ant society we report here, there can be little doubt that this intercontinental supercolony represents the most populous known animal society.},

Like all other organisms, insects and related arthropods mainly utilize chemistry to adapt to these environments in a wide variety of ways, such as for defense against predation or infection, communication and socialization, life cycle development, and surviving environmental conditions. Arthropods harbor a large variety of chemical substances used for these ecological adaptations, and this is the overarching theme of the field of chemical ecology. Progress in the field has advanced rapidly, and this comprehensive review summarizes the enormous potential for discovery of new natural products with medicinal value from among the phylum Arthropoda. This review: (1) introduces the topic of arthropod chemical biodiversity; (2) reviews cultural uses of arthropods as medicines; (3) provides an overview of insect chemical defense studies and modern natural product analytical methods; (4) describes examples from the literature of insect-derived substances with medicinally relevant biological properties; and (5) summarizes the aforementioned topics to emphasize the value of arthropods as reservoirs of potentially useful new natural products.},

Self-sacrifice has also been observed as a form of preemptive defense against parasites and pathogens where individuals will abandon their normal colony function and die in self-exile to reduce the risk of infecting nestmates.

Eleven species out of 12 put up a rather strong resistance to raiding P. megacephala workers in Cameroon compared to only three species out of 11 in Mexico, where only colonies of Solenopsis geminata, Dorymyrmex pyramicus and Dolichoderus bispinosus resisted these raids. We conclude that P. megacephala's heightened ability to successfully raid colonies of competing ants may help explain its success and the decline of native ants in areas where it has been introduced.

Résumé
Nous avons étudié le comportement de la fourmi envahissante Pheidole megacephala confrontée avec des colonies d'autres fourmis du Cameroun, faisant partie de son aire d'origine, et du Mexique où elle a été introduite. Au Cameroun, 11 espèces sur 12 ont montré une résistance plutôt forte aux raids de P. megacephala en comparaison de trois espèces sur 11 au Mexique, où les colonies de Solenopsis geminata, Dorymyrmex pyramicus et Dolichoderus bispinosus ont bien résisté aux raids. Nous concluons que la capacité de P. megacephala de piller les nids des autres fourmis peut expliquer en partie son succès et le déclin des espèces natives dans les zones où elle a été introduite.

	abstract = {Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a “genetic cleansing” of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles. The main supercolony, which ranges over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast, effectively forms the largest cooperative unit ever recorded.},

	abstract = {All societies are characterized by the capacity of their members to distinguish one another from outsiders. Ants are among the species that form “anonymous societies”: members are not required to tell each other apart as individuals for the group to remain unified. Rather, each society depends on shared cues recognized by all its members. These cues permit societies to reach populations in the low millions in certain ant and termite species, and to grow indefinitely populous, expansive, and possibly long lasting in a few other ant species, which are described as having supercolonies. Anonymous societies are contrasted with “individual recognition societies” such as those of most vertebrates, which are limited to a few individuals by the necessity that the members individually recognize each other. The shared recognition cues of ants provide clear criteria for defining colonies and are what enables a supercolony to remain a single society no matter how large it becomes. I examine the often conflicting ideas about the best studied ant with supercolonies, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Its invasive supercolonies, containing in some cases billions of workers and queens spread over hundreds of square kilometers, can be most parsimoniously understood as single colonies that have had an opportunity to expand across regions of suitable habitat because of a lack of well-matched competitors. This capacity for unrestricted growth is the defining characteristic of supercolonies. There is no evidence that the local patchiness of nests and patterns of worker and food traffic within these wide-ranging populations are so invariant that supercolonies do not exist but instead are collections of numerous independent nest clusters that should be called “colonies.” Nor is there evidence for the hypothesis that invasive supercolonies have been able to grow large and successful overseas only as a result of evolving through genetic drift or selection to become fundamentally different from the smaller colonies typical of the species’ region of origin around northern Argentina. The most unique feature of the Argentine ant, however, is not that its colonies are anonymous or that they can grow indefinitely large—though the last trait is found only in a few ant species and humans. Rather, it is that Argentine ant colonies do not interbreed. Indeed, the only fighting among Argentine ants occurs along colony borders, which even reproductives seldom, if ever, cross and survive. For this reason, each Argentine ant supercolony acts as virtually a sibling species.},

	abstract = {We investigated kin relatedness and kin-recognition abilities of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), an invader from North America that has pervaded Japan for 20 yr, using genetic analyses and behavioral bioassays. From these data and interactions among factors, we formulated an eradication and management time-scale pattern diagram. Relatedness within a colony using microsatellite markers was effectively zero, whereas relatedness estimated by multilocus DNA fingerprinting markers was relatively high. Specifically, relatedness of recently invaded populations was estimated at nearly 0.3. From the results of behavioral bioassays on the invading populations of the Argentine ant, all colonies except the Kobe supercolonies did not show clearly aggressive behaviors toward workers belonging to other colonies, even when distantly located. Because they are critical factors for eradicating and managing invasive organisms, we assessed the relationships among kin relatedness using multilocus DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite markers, with aggressiveness, in 2011 and 2012, including the establishment durations, and distances among supercolonies. A generalized linear model (GLM) analysis, with establishment durations as an explanatory variable, strongly contributed to explaining estimated relatedness from the two methods. Specifically, models using kin relatedness for both multilocus DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite markers provided the strongest contribution to explaining the establishment durations. Within 3 yr after establishment in a native area, eradication is possible because of their low genetic diversity and small colony size. After 15 yr, eradication will be more difficult, but it is preferable to just monitor the impact for a nonnative ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Invasive ants are major agricultural and urban pests and a significant concern in conservation areas. Despite long history of control and eradication efforts, invasive ants continue to spread around the globe driven by a multitude of synergistic factors. Lack of effective management tools is one of the biggest challenges in controlling invasive ants. The goal of the current study was to improve the efficacy and safety of ant management and to develop effective control strategies for sensitive conservation areas. We utilized the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) as a model system to evaluate a target-specific pesticide delivery system that exploits the interconnected nature of social insect colonies to distribute a toxicant effectively within the colony. The approach, based entirely on horizontal transfer, takes advantage of various levels of social interactions in ant colonies to disseminate a toxicant throughout the colony. Results of laboratory studies coupled with LC/MS/MS analysis demonstrate that fipronil is toxic to Argentine ants in extremely small (nanogram) quantities and is efficiently transferred from a single treated donor to multiple recipients, causing significant secondary mortality. A field study was conducted in native fynbos plots invaded by Argentine ants. The study consisted of collecting naïve workers, treating them with fipronil, and releasing them within invaded plots. Results show that the release of fipronil-treated ants reduced Argentine ant abundance by {\textgreater}90\% within 24 h. The horizontal transfer approach offers environmental benefits with regard to pesticide use in ecologically sensitive environments and appears ideally suited for ant management in conservation areas.},

	abstract = {Most ants live in closed societies from which non-members are excluded through fighting or ritualized displays to protect colony resources. Nestmate recognition is the process by which ants discriminate nestmate from non-nestmate ants. Ants use cues coded in mixtures of long-chain hydrocarbon compounds on the cuticle as nestmate recognition cues. Pavement ants (Tetramorium caespitum) form conspicuous wars between neighboring colonies that are organized after workers meet and make the decision to fight after assessing nestmate recognition cues. These wars involve thousands of individuals. Fighting is ritualized and few ants die in the process. We identified 24 cuticular hydrocarbon compounds, above 1\% in relative abundance, in the profile of pavement ants with chain lengths ranging from 15 to 31 carbon atoms. Cuticular lipids contained, in order of abundance: mono-methyl alkanes (45–56\%), n-alkanes (range: 16–40\% relative abundance), and alkenes (10–20\%), with small or trace amounts of di-methyl, tri-methyl alkanes and fatty acids. Results from behavioral tests show that pavement ants assess information in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles to recognize both conspecific and heterospecfic (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis and Camponotus modoc) non-nestmate ants and that the relative abundance of methyl-branched alkanes and alkenes codes for nestmate status, at least for conspecific interactions. Our data add to a growing body of knowledge about how ants use cuticular hydrocarbon based nestmate recognition cues to prevent the intrusion of non-nestmates in to colony space.},

Predacious ants typically devour their insect prey within a short time. Given a bonanza of insect prey, the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, desiccates small pieces of these insects (creating insect "jerky") and stockpiles these pieces in its mound, immediately below the mound surface, the driest and warmest location in the nest. Feeding colonies fluorescently dyed beetle larvae, and searching for fluorescence at night under ultraviolet light illumination verified such stockpiling. Stockpiles ranged from a few pieces to hundreds. Ant larvae in field colonies fed a single dose of dyed beetle larvae remained fluorescent for about two weeks. Laboratory colonies were fed a single dose of dyed larvae and then either starved of insect food, or fed on undyed larvae. All larvae in starved colonies remained strongly fluorescent for four weeks, whereas those in fed colonies gradually declined in fluorescence, showing that in the absence of an inflow of insect prey, workers in the starved colonies fed the dried insect fragments to larvae. Storage of dried food is easily overlooked, and it is possible that it is not limited to fire ants.},

	abstract = {During the process of coevolution, social parasites have evolved sophisticated strategies to exploit the brood care behavior of their social hosts. Slave-making ant queens invade host colonies and kill or eject all adult host ants. Host workers, which eclose from the remaining brood, are tricked into caring for the parasite brood. Due to their high prevalence and frequent raids, following which stolen host broods are similarly enslaved, slave-making ants exert substantial selection upon their hosts, leading to the evolution of antiparasite adaptations. However, all host defenses shown to date are active before host workers are parasitized, whereas selection was thought to be unable to act on traits of already enslaved hosts. Yet, here we demonstrate the rebellion of enslaved Temnothorax workers, which kill two-thirds of the female pupae of the slave-making ant Protomognathus americanus. Thereby, slaves decrease the long-term parasite impact on surrounding related host colonies. This novel antiparasite strategy of enslaved workers constitutes a new level in the coevolutionary battle after host colony defense has failed. Our discovery is analogous to recent findings in hosts of avian brood parasites where perfect mimicry of parasite eggs leads to the evolution of chick recognition as a second line of defense.},

Instead, opponents confront one another in highly aggressive displays, during which they walk on stilt legs while raising their abdomens and heads. The tournaments serve as temporary spatial borders within which food gathering occurs. In this study we develop the hypothesis that tournaments are a mechanism of intercolony communication, which opposing colonies use to gauge each other's strength. Models are proposed for the behaviorial procedures that seem most likely to underly this capacity. For the first time it is possible to ascertain and compare the properties of such models in relation to a body of test data. It appears probable to us that intercolony communication in this species of ant may depend upon a novel capacity for integrative information harvesting by individual workers.},

	abstract = {Polyrhachis laboriosa andCamponotus brutus are two syntopic ants of the African equatorial forest. Although they occupy two different ecological niches (nesting area, diet, rhythms of activity), they are in competition for the exploitation of large permanent food sources.
C. brutus, which is nocturnal, changed its rhythm of activity in the presence of large permanent food sources to exploit it day and night, whileP. laboriosa, diurnal, did not change its rhythm of activity. Encounters between workers of the two species at the food source always resulted in duels, even though several other workers were present. When attacked byC. brutus, P. laboriosa workers showed a novel flee-return strategy (fleeing over a 20-cm distance and returning to the source) instead of escaping definitively from the source and displayed ritualized behavior (i.e., fleeing, raising the gaster, flexing the gaster). These types of behavior appeasedC. brutus workers and enabledP. laboriosa to avoid overt aggression and to exploit the source in spite of the presence of a competitor.
C. brutus also exhibited ritualized behavior during the duels (i.e., back-and-forth jerking of the body, series of light bites on a leg).C. brutus intimidatedP. laboriosa rather than really attacking it. This ritualization, used at an interspecific level, may be the result of a coevolutionary process or the effect of learning that certain types of behavior are beneficial. In any case, both species benefit from the possibility of exploiting large permanent food sources through confrontations that never lead to overt aggression.},

	abstract = {Slave-making ants are social parasites which exploit the workforce of heterospecific slaves for their own reproduction, and to this end they have developed a variety of morphological and behavioural adaptations. Furthermore, social parasites utilize the chemical communication system of their hosts by breaking their nestmate recognition code, and some slave-maker species additionally employ semiochemicals as weapons during colony foundation and slaveraiding. Here, we demonstrate the use of such a ‘propaganda allomone’ by the North American myrmicine slave-maker Protomognathus americanus. This substance is produced in the Dufour’s gland and may be employed during slave raids to elicit panic among defending host workers. Slave-maker Dufour’s gland secretions evoked agitation and heightened levels of activity among host workers when applied directly on a host nest, and strong aggressive responses of nestmates when applied onto a host worker. Although the hosts own Dufour’s gland secretion also elicits intra-colonial fights, no support for the hypothesis was found that the slave-maker propaganda substance mimics a fertility signal of the host, as the chemical profile of the gland secretions is highly divergent between the two species. Preliminary results on the chemical composition of the secretion obtained by gas chromatography indicate that the propaganda substance of P. americanus differs from that of the related European slavemaker Harpagoxenus sublaevis, and is thus likely to represent an independent evolutionary development.},

	shorttitle = {Chemical strategies to deal with ants},
	abstract = {Chemical tactics by ant social parasites, including myrmecophiles, often relate to ant nestmate recognition and alarm communication. The strict nestmate recognition system in ants can be disrupted by chemical imitation of the nestmate recognition pheromone, which consists of cuticular hydrocarbon components. Social parasites often acquire these com-ponents through direct body contact, but occasionally synthesize them even before ant adoption. Such an imitation of the host cuticular chemicals causes species-specific adoption of the parasites, which are then often taken care of by ants for long terms. In contrast, transient invaders often use a propaganda allomone that induces panic alarm responses in ants. The allomone occasionally even causes fighting among nestmate ants, and seems to disrupt the ant nestmate recogni-tion. These two chemical strategies are to modify the ant responses after ant detection. A third chemical strategy taken by some insect species is to avoid the detection itself, and is evidenced in the chemical phytomimesis by geometriid twig-like caterpillars. Since this counts upon the ants not to respond to the "invasion", it usually does not cause visible re-sponses when it works effectively. Appropriate evaluation methods are necessary to evaluate the ant responses induced by the parasites to reveal the underlying mimetic strategy.},

(Myrafant) nylanderi, lives in rotting pine, oak, and elder sticks and may locally reach densities of 10 nests per m2. In the studied sites, only a small fraction of colonies were polydomous, i.e. single colonies typically did not inhabit several nest sites. The home ranges of nylanderi colonies overlap the ranges of other conspecific colonies and colonies of other species, especially L. (s.str.) gredleri. Foragers from different colonies encountering one another in the field back off without exhibiting strong aggression, suggesting that colonies do not defend absolute foraging territories. In laboratory experiments, the frequency and severity of agonistic interactions among workers from different colonies, all living in pine sticks, increased significantly with the distance between their nests. Workers from colonies nesting in different types of wood exhibited significantly more aggression. Experiments in which we transferred colonies from pine sticks into artificial pine or oak nests corroborate the hypothesis that nesting material strongly influences colony odour in L. nylanderi. The evolutionary significance of this apparent dear-enemy phenomenon is discussed.},

The “square law” describes a scenario in which small-sized competitors may use a numerical advantage to overcome large-sized competitors in simultaneous combat. The “linear law” describes how a competitor with large-sized fighting units may use one-on-one combat to favor victory when outnumbered. Lanchester's laws have been suggested as an important regulator of interspecific competition in social insects, but without experimental support. In this study, experimental platforms were designed to invoke the conditions of both Lanchester's laws in a community of ants in lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. I measured behavioral dominance at the food platforms in two separate manners: an ordinal ranking of the number of workers present, and the monopoly of the food platforms. At the platform invoking simultaneous combat, satisfying the square law, small-sized ants were more behaviorally dominant by numerical superiority. At the platform invoking one-on-one combat, satisfying the linear law, larger ants were more behaviorally dominant by monopoly. These results suggest that Lanchester's laws explain, in part, the outcome of interspecific competition in ants.},

In Ride of the Second Horseman, O'Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmental structure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistence patterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O'Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500 BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependent upon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves were taken to provide labor. O'Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively and pragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in a culture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O'Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did. Fascinating and provocative, Ride of the Second Horseman offers a far-reaching tour of human history that suggests the age-old cycle of war may now be near its end.},

	abstract = {The ecological success of invasive ants has been linked to their ability to form expansive supercolonies. In the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), increased productivity and competitive ability of introduced supercolonies in several places, e. g., California and southern Europe, has been linked to high population densities that could have been attained via fusion of nonaggressive and genetically similar nests. Recently, we have found that introduced L. humile colonies in the southeastern United States, which have higher levels of intraspecific aggression and genetic diversity than those in California and southern Europe, sometimes also fuse; yet it is unclear what the longer term consequences of such colony fusion might be. In this study, we examined whether fusion of these southeastern United States L. humile colonies results in larger colonies by recording colony size and productivity in pairs that fused and in pairs that did not fuse. After 6 mo, colonies that fused produced 47\% more workers and had twice as many queens as colony pairs that did not fuse. Also, fused colonies had an overall per capita colony productivity (number of brood and workers produced per queen and per worker) comparable to that of nonfused pairs and unpaired controls. Furthermore, all queens contributed to worker pupae production in fused colonies. Thus, fusion of initially aggressive southeastern United States L. humile colonies results in colonies with higher worker number without decreasing per capita productivity. Moreover, offspring contribution by all queens in fused colonies may alter colony genotypic composition resulting in reduced intraspecific aggression that in turn promotes further fusion. This process may be relevant to the establishment of incipient colonies in areas where multiple introductions have occurred.},

	abstract = {Some species of ants possess an unusual form of social organization in which aggression among nests is absent. This type of social organization, called unicoloniality, has been studied in only a handful of species and its evolutionary origins remain unclear. To date, no study has examined behavioural and genetic patterns at points of contact between the massive supercolonies that characterize unicoloniality. Since interactions at territory boundaries influence the costs of aggression and the likelihood of gene flow, such data may illuminate how supercolonies are formed and maintained. Here we provide field data on intraspecific territoriality for a widespread and invasive unicolonial social insect, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We observed abrupt and well-defined behavioural boundaries at 16 contact zones between three different pairs of supercolonies. We visited nine of these zones weekly during a six-month period and observed consistent and intense intercolony aggression that resulted in variable, but often large, levels of worker mortality. Microsatellite variation along six transects across territory borders showed that FST values were lower within supercolonies (0.08 ± 0.01 (mean ± SE)) than between supercolonies (0.29 ± 0.01) and that this disparity was especially strong right at territory borders, despite direct and prolonged contact between the supercolonies. Matrix correspondence tests confirmed that levels of aggression and genetic differentiation were significantly correlated, but no relationship existed between geographic distance and either intraspecific aggression or genetic differentiation. Patterns of FST variation indicated high levels of gene flow within supercolonies, but little to no gene flow between them. Overall, these findings are inconsistent with a model of relaxed ecological constraints leading to colony fusion and suggest that environmentally derived cues are not the prime determined of nestmate recognition in field populations of Argentine ants.},

	abstract = {How workers within an ant colony perceive and enforce colony boundaries is a defining biological feature of an ant species. Ants fall along a spectrum of social organizations ranging from single-queen, single nest societies to species with multi-queen societies in which workers exhibit colony-specific, altruistic behaviors towards non-nestmate workers from distant locations. Defining where an ant species falls along this spectrum is critical for understanding its basic ecology. Herein we quantify queen numbers, describe intraspecific aggression, and characterize the distribution of colony sizes for tawny crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva) populations in native range areas in South America as well as in their introduced range in the Southeastern United States. In both ranges, multi-queen nests are common. In the introduced range, aggressive behaviors are absent at all spatial scales tested, indicating that within the population in the Southeastern United States N. fulva is unicolonial. However, this contrasts strongly with intraspecific aggression in its South American native range. In the native range, intraspecific aggression between ants from different nests is common and ritualized. Aggression is typically one-sided and follows a stereotyped sequence of escalating behaviors that stops before actual fighting occurs. Spatial patterns of non-aggressive nest aggregation and the transitivity of non-aggressive interactions demonstrate that results of neutral arena assays usefully delineate colony boundaries. In the native range, both the spatial extent of colonies and the average number of queens encountered per nest differ between sites. This intercontinental comparison presents the first description of intraspecific aggressive behavior for this invasive ant and characterizes the variation in colony organization in the native-range, a pre-requisite to a full understanding of the origins of unicoloniality in its introduced range.},

Fungus-farming “attine” ant species have complex cuticular modifications and specialized glands that house and nourish antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria symbionts, which in turn protect their hosts’ fungus gardens from pathogens. Here we reconstruct ant–Actinobacteria evolutionary history across the full range of variation within subtribe Attina by combining dated phylogenomic and ultramorphological analyses. Ancestral-state analyses indicate the ant–Actinobacteria symbiosis arose early in attine-ant evolution, a conclusion consistent with direct observations of Actinobacteria on fossil ants in Oligo-Miocene amber. qPCR indicates that the dominant ant-associated Actinobacteria belong to the genus Pseudonocardia. Tracing the evolutionary trajectories of Pseudonocardia-maintaining mechanisms across attine ants reveals a continuum of adaptations. In Myrmicocrypta species, which retain many ancestral morphological and behavioral traits, Pseudonocardia occur in specific locations on the legs and antennae, unassociated with any specialized structures. In contrast, specialized cuticular structures, including crypts and tubercles, evolved at least three times in derived attine-ant lineages. Conspicuous caste differences in Pseudonocardia-maintaining structures, in which specialized structures are present in worker ants and queens but reduced or lost in males, are consistent with vertical Pseudonocardia transmission. Although the majority of attine ants are associated with Pseudonocardia, there have been multiple losses of bacterial symbionts and bacteria-maintaining structures in different lineages over evolutionary time. The early origin of ant–Pseudonocardia mutualism and the multiple evolutionary convergences on strikingly similar anatomical adaptations for maintaining bacterial symbionts indicate that Pseudonocardia have played a critical role in the evolution of ant fungiculture.},

This symbiosis evolved approximately 50–60 million years ago in the late Paleocene or early Eocene, and since its origin attine ants have acquired a variety of fungal mutualists in the Leucocoprineae and the distantly related Pterulaceae. The most specialized symbiotic interaction is referred to as “higher agriculture” and includes leafcutter ant agriculture in which the ants cultivate the single species Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. Higher agriculture fungal cultivars are characterized by specialized hyphal tip swellings, so-called gongylidia, which are considered a unique, derived morphological adaptation of higher attine fungi thought to be absent in lower attine fungi. Rare reports of gongylidia-like structures in fungus gardens of lower attines exist, but it was never tested whether these represent rare switches of lower attines to L. gonglyphorus cultivars or whether lower attine cultivars occasionally produce gongylidia. Here we describe the occurrence of gongylidia-like structures in fungus gardens of the asexual lower attine ant Mycocepurus smithii. To test whether M. smithii cultivates leafcutter ant fungi or whether lower attine cultivars produce gongylidia, we identified the M. smithii fungus utilizing molecular and morphological methods. Results shows that the gongylidia-like structures of M. smithii gardens are morphologically similar to gongylidia of higher attine fungus gardens and can only be distinguished by their slightly smaller size. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the fungal ITS sequence indicates that the gongylidia-bearing M. smithii cultivar belongs to the so-called “Clade 1”of lower Attini cultivars. Given that M. smithii is capable of cultivating a morphologically and genetically diverse array of fungal symbionts, we discuss whether asexuality of the ant host maybe correlated with low partner fidelity and active symbiont choice between fungus and ant mutualists.},

In a typical rainforest, endless processions of workers transport leaf forage on cleared highways across the forest floor, each worker balancing a leaf fragment like an oversized green umbrella (Fig. 1). The ants do not eat the leaves, but they use them as garden compost to grow a nutritious fungus, the ants' main diet. So efficient is the conversion of leaves into fungal food that the ant–fungus symbiosis has been called “one of the breakthroughs in animal evolution” (1), on par with such major evolutionary innovations as the ungulate rumen or the powered flight of birds. Leaf-cutter ants consume more vegetation than any other comparable herbivore (2), making them major agricultural pests. Early Brazilian farmers were so frustrated in their battles against the saúva (leafcutter ants) that they concluded “Brazil must kill the saúva or the saúva will kill Brazil.”

Leaf-cutter ants are the ecologically conspicuous representatives of a larger group of more than 200 fungus-growing (attine) ant species, most of which do not cut leaves and instead use leaf-litter debris for fungal cultivation (3, 4). The common feature of all fungus-growing ants is their astonishing proficiency in planting, manuring, weeding, and sheltering fungal gardens, but the specific fungicultural habits are remarkably diverse among ant species, suggesting a long and …

Ants' wide diversity of nesting habits and relationships with plants and prey types implies that these chemicals are also very diverse. Using the African myrmicine ant Crematogaster striatula as our focal species, we adopted a three-pronged research approach. We studied the aggressive and predatory behaviors of the ant workers, conducted bioassays on the effect of their Dufour gland contents on termites, and analyzed these contents. (1) The workers defend themselves or eliminate termites by orienting their abdominal tip toward the opponent, stinger protruded. The chemicals emitted, apparently volatile, trigger the recruitment of nestmates situated in the vicinity and act without the stinger having to come into direct contact with the opponent. Whereas alien ants competing with C. striatula for sugary food sources are repelled by this behavior and retreat further and further away, termites defend their nest whatever the danger. They face down C. striatula workers and end up by rolling onto their backs, their legs batting the air. (2) The bioassays showed that the toxicity of the Dufour gland contents acts in a time-dependent manner, leading to the irreversible paralysis, and, ultimately, death of the termites. (3) Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed that the Dufour gland contains a mixture of mono- or polyunsaturated long-chain derivatives, bearing functional groups like oxo-alcohols or oxo-acetates. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry showed the presence of a molecule of 1584 Da that might be a large, acetylated alkaloid capable of splitting into smaller molecules that could be responsible for the final degree of venom toxicity.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00040-007-0954-5},
	abstract = {Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in their native South American range, like most other ant species, form spatially restricted colonies that display high
levels of aggression toward other such colonies. In their introduced range, Argentine ants are unicolonial and form massive
supercolonies composed of numerous nests among which territorial boundaries are absent. Here we examine the role of cuticular
hydrocarbons (CHCs) in nestmate recognition of this highly damaging invasive ant using three supercolonies from its introduced
range. We conducted behavioral assays to test the response of Argentine ants to workers treated with colonymate or non-colonymate
CHCs. Additionally, we quantified the amount of hydrocarbons transferred to individual ants and performed gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) to qualitatively characterize our manipulation of CHC profiles. The GC/MS data revealed marked differences
in the hydrocarbon profiles across supercolonies and indicated that our treatment effectively masked the original chemical
profile of the treated ants with the profile belonging to the foreign individuals. We found that individual workers treated
with foreign CHCs were aggressively rejected by their colonymates and this behavior appears to be concentration-dependent:
larger quantities of foreign CHCs triggered higher levels of aggression. Moreover, this response was not simply due to an
increase in the amount of CHCs applied to the cuticle since treatment with high concentrations of nestmate CHCs did not trigger
aggression.The results of this study bolster the findings of previous studies on social insects that have implicated CHCs
as nestmate recognition cues and provide insight into the mechanisms of nestmate recognition in the invasive Argentine ant.},

In northern California, however, the native winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) persists in invaded areas. We found that in aggressive interactions between the two species, P. imparis employs a potent defensive secretion. Field observations were conducted at P. imparis nest sites both in the presence and absence of L. humile. These observations suggested and laboratory assays confirmed that P. imparis workers are more likely to secrete when outnumbered by L. humile. Workers of P. imparis were also more likely to secrete near their nest entrances than when foraging on trees. One-on-one laboratory trials showed that the P. imparis secretion is highly lethal to L. humile, causing 79\% mortality. The nonpolar fraction of the secretion was chemically analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and found to be composed of long-chain and cyclic hydrocarbons. Chemical analysis of dissected P. imparis workers showed that the nonpolar fraction is derived from the Dufour's gland. Based on these conclusions, we hypothesize that this chemical defense may help P. imparis to resist displacement by L. humile.},

	abstract = {Consistent differences in behavior among individual animals, also known as animal personalities, are ubiquitous. In social insects, there is more than one biological scale at which individuals differ from one another in behavior: workers and colonies. In most ants, natural selection acts at the level of the colony, therefore differences in collective behavior among colonies can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here, we review the recent literature on consistent individual differences among ant colonies in their collective behavior, that is, colony personality. We discuss the causes and consequences of colony personalities and highlight unanswered questions that can be examined uniquely by studying ants. We argue that ants are a distinctive study system for examining the links between the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of personality and the ecological consequences of personalities because of their ability to shape their local environment, that is, their nest. We end with an example of how the study of colony personality might be applied to identify solutions for challenges in conservation biology. Overall, the study of ant colony personality opens up new opportunities for examining the evolutionary history of animal personalities and the feedback between the underlying mechanisms and ecological consequences of animal personalities.Open access, licensed under CC BY 4.0. © 2020 The Author(s).DOI: 10.25849/myrmecol.news\_031:47 Pages: 47-59 Volume: 31 Year: 2021 Journal: Myrmecol.

What social and biological factors influence chimpanzee development? At the Fall Stated Meeting of the Western Center, held at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California, Jane van Lawick-Goodall and David A. Hamburg presented their recent findings on various aspects of primate behavior including attachment and loss, family ties, dominance, subsistence patterns, and reproduction. The speakers were introduced by Dr. Laurence Pinneo, Manager of the Neurophysiology Program at SRI, whose work includes long-term observations of young chimpanzees raised without exposure to adult chimpanzees or human models from which to learn. The development of these animals will be studied further at a new primate research center established at Stanford University by Drs. Goodall and Hamburg. For the past fourteen years, Jane Goodall has studied chimpanzees in their natural habitat along the Gombe Stream in Tanzania, East Africa. In the mid-1960's, she began to develop the Gombe Stream Research Center as a field station where students could study chimpanzee and baboon behavior in the field; today some fifteen students are working at the Center under her supervision. The Gombe Stream Research Center is now affiliated with Stanford University where Drs. Goodall and Hamburg are presently setting up Gombe West, a unique facility which combines the features of a fully-operating laboratory and a semi-natural habitat. The results of Dr. Goodall's research have been documented in scientific publications, in films photographed by her husband, Baron van Lawick, and in her book, In the Shadow of Man - an account of ten years of observing the chimpanzees at Gombe Stream. At the Western Center meeting, Dr. Goodall illustrated her remarks with numerous slides of chimpanzee behavior and concluded the evening with a selection from her forthcoming educational film, showing chimpanzee adults sharing food with each other and with their children. The only other primate species characteristically exhibiting this type of behavior is man.},

A recent taxonomic revision of the genus Tapinoma in Europe revealed that the supercolonial species Tapinoma nigerrimum consists of a complex of four cryptic species. Two of them, Tapinoma magnum and the newly described Tapinoma darioi, are closely related species that evolutionary diverged recently. In this work, we determine and characterize the chemical profile of pheromones and volatile compounds of two Tapinoma species. From a chemical point of view, T. darioi and T. magnum show both qualitative and quantitative differences in the pheromones produced, supporting the taxonomic revision of the T. nigerrimum complex. Our data confirm T. darioi and T. magnum as separate species also from a biochemical point of view demonstrating the value of chemotaxonomy as a suitable tool for integrative studies of species differentiation even for closely related taxa.},

Chemical defense is prominent and no less than six different exocrine glands have been reported as sources of defensive compounds (1).

Foraging workers utilize this air-dispersed venom (up to 500 ng) to repel heterospecifics encountered in the foraging arena, while brood tenders dispense smaller quantities (∼ 1 ng) to the brood surface, presumably as an antibiotic. Brood tenders removed from the brood cell and tested in heteropspecific encounters in the foraging arena exhibited the complete repertoire of agonistic gaster flagging behavior.

Semiochemicals used for interindividual nestmate recognition are also involved in the mechanisms of tolerance and association between the species, and social parasites exploit these mechanisms. The obligate parasites are odorless (“chemical insignificance”) at the time of usurpation, like all other callow ants, and this “invisibility” enables their entry into the host colony. By chemical mimicry (sensu lato), they later integrate the gestalt odor of this colony (“chemical integration”). We hypothesize that host and parasite are likely to be related chemically, thereby facilitating the necessary mimicry to permit bypassing the colony odor barrier. We also review the plethora of chemical weapons used by social parasites (propaganda, appeasement, and/or repellent substances), particularly during the usurpation period, when the young mated parasite queen synthesizes these chemicals before usurpation and ceases such biosynthesis afterwards. We discuss evolutionary trends that may have led to social parasitism, focusing on the question of whether slave-making ants and their host species are expected to engage in a coevolutionary arms race.},

However, cases of “social rejection or exclusion” have been observed in three different behavioral contexts. Most frequently, a chimpanzee is the target of hostility as the result of competitive interaction within the community; in such cases, social cohesion counterbalances rejection, typically leading to integration within a relatively stable pattern of dominance and social interaction. The occasional departure of an individual who has been the target of aggression —like the withdrawal of Evered after repeated attacks by Figan and Faban—seems due to persistent hostility by a few males rather than general “ostracism” by the group as a whole. A second form of exclusion concerns outsiders found in the home range of the group: in these cases, hostility is more generalized, particularly in response to the attempt of an adult female with offspring to join the community. Finally, there are the rarely observed instances of shunning a group member whose behavior seems abnormal the social rejection of Pepe and Old Mr. McGregor after they suffered from polio.},

Individuals that perceive themselves as being in a group with high RHP may receive a motivational increase and increase their aggression levels. Alternatively, individuals in lower RHP groups may increase their aggression levels in an attempt to overcome the RHP deficit. We investigate how ‘group RHP’ influences agonistic tactics in red wood ants Formica rufa. Larger groups had higher total agonistic indices, but per capita agonistic indices were highest in the smallest groups, indicating that individuals in smaller groups fought harder. Agonistic indices were influenced by relative mean mass, focal group size, opponent group size and opponent group agonistic index. Focal group attrition rates decreased as focal group relative agonistic indices increased and there was a strong negative influence of relative mean mass. The highest focal attrition rates were received when opponent groups were numerically large and composed of large individuals. Thus, fight tactics in F. rufa seem to vary with both aspects of group RHP, group size and the individual attributes of group members, indicating that information on these are available to fighting ants.},

Originally developed to describe human warfare, Lanchester's square law has been hypothesized to apply broadly to social animals as well, with important consequences for their aggressive behaviour and social structure. According to the square law, the fighting ability of a group is proportional to the square of the number of individuals, but rises only linearly with fighting ability of individuals within the group. By analyzing mortality rates of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) fighting in different numerical ratios, we provide the first quantitative test of Lanchester's model for a non-human animal. Casualty rates of fire ants were not consistent with the square law; instead, group fighting ability was an approximately linear function of group size. This implies that the relative numbers of casualties incurred by two fighting groups are not strongly affected by relative group sizes and that battles do not disproportionately favour group size over individual prowess.},

Since fighting in social animals can involve intragroup cooperation, the distribution of individual RHPs within the group could influence overall group ability. Thus, the total group fighting prowess might not simply equate to the sum of individual RHPs. We investigated the effects of within-group variance in individual RHP during battles in wood ants, Formica rufa. Rival groups were matched in number of individuals and mean body size of individuals but differed in the variance among body sizes. Larger individuals were most aggressive and small individuals were least aggressive. Overall, small individuals had the highest attrition rate and large individuals the lowest, with medium-sized individuals experiencing moderate attrition rates. Consequently, aggression and attrition rates in low-variance groups did not differ significantly from rates in high-variance groups, indicating that when group size and mean body mass are equal, the distribution of individual RHPs does not influence the overall fighting ability of the group. Rather, it appears that large individuals are able to compensate for poor performance by weaker group members.},

	abstract = {The Lanchester models of combat were originally created for human warfare. These models were inspired by advances in technology and automatic weaponry at the turn of the 20th century. They parameterize army group size and individual fighting ability to explain the mortality rate of soldiers in a group during battle. In the last few decades, they have been applied to conflicts involving interactions between groups of nonhuman animals of varying degrees of sociality. This review focuses on the predictions and applications of Lanchester laws to nonhuman animal contests. Behavioral researchers have used the Lanchester models to interpret a variety of life history strategies and behaviors, such as colony fission in army ants, size differences in native versus non-native ants, recruitment behavior in chimpanzees, and dominance hierarchies in birds. These researchers assumed that the Lanchester laws apply qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively, to the specific circumstances studied. To increase their biological realism, mathematical modifications have been proposed. While applications suggest that these laws may explain a multitude of social behaviors, there are surprisingly few empirical tests. Thus, further empirical data are needed to fully assess the accuracy of the models in predicting outcomes in nonhuman animals and their usefulness to biological systems.},

Theory predicts that agonistic signals should vary with RHP and any decision to ‘give up’ should be made by the opponent with lower RHP. In some species, an encounter is only resolved when one opponent is killed or critically injured. We investigated fatal fighting between groups of red wood ants, Formica rufa, and determined whether the probability that a focal group inflicts the first fatality in an encounter is influenced by the same correlates of RHP demonstrated to affect noninjurious fight outcome. In addition, we manipulated group size, an additional factor which is likely to be linked to RHP during intergroup conflicts, to determine whether members of larger groups concentrate attacks on their less numerous opponents. We found that, during most encounters, focal groups that inflicted the first fatality contained individuals of larger mean body mass than groups that received the first fatality. There was no evidence that energetic status directly influenced outcome, although groups that received the first fatality experienced a significant reduction in total body sugar compared to nonfighting controls. Finally, we found no evidence to suggest F. rufa concentrate their attacks in a way that leads to enhanced group RHP.},

How victors compensate for potential costs and minimize the threat of Pyrrhic victory is not well known. We tracked the outcomes of experimentally induced field conflicts between highly territorial acacia ant Crematogaster mimosae colonies. We provide evidence that the victors of colony fights have reduced worker forces to defend larger territories. Field assays indicate that postfight colonies are more vulnerable to heavy browsing of host trees by mega-herbivores and takeover by competitors following conflict. Using molecular genetics, we discovered that fatal fights significantly decrease within-colony worker relatedness. We find that reduced relatedness can be explained by colonies increasing worker number via 1) non-kin enemy adoption or 2) queen-right colony fusion. We hypothesize that incorporating non-kin enemies can speed recovery from conflict when resource defense is paramount. In the case of queen-right colony fusion, territorial defense benefits could outweigh fitness costs. We discuss the implications of our findings for ant colony cohesion and recognition systems.},

Here we document the interaction dynamics among a Sericomyrmex fungus-growing ant host, a permanently associated parasitic guest ant of the genus Megalomyrmex, and a raiding agro-predator of the genus Gnamptogenys. We show experimentally that the guest ants protect their host colonies against agro-predator raids using alkaloid venom that is much more potent than the biting defenses of the host ants. Relatively few guest ants are sufficient to kill raiders that invariably exterminate host nests without a cohabiting guest ant colony. We also show that the odor of guest ants discourages raider scouts from recruiting nestmates to host colonies. Our results imply that Sericomyrmex fungus-growers obtain a net benefit from their costly guest ants behaving as a functional soldier caste to meet lethal threats from agro-predator raiders. The fundamentally different life histories of the agro-predators and guest ants appear to facilitate their coexistence in a negative frequency-dependent manner. Because a guest ant colony is committed for life to a single host colony, the guests would harm their own interests by not defending the host that they continue to exploit. This conditional mutualism is analogous to chronic sickle cell anemia enhancing the resistance to malaria and to episodes in human history when mercenary city defenders offered either net benefits or imposed net costs, depending on the level of threat from invading armies.},

been dismissed in all but a tiny minority of insect societies.
“
Team” is a term not generally used in studies of vertebrates. We

propose a new rigorous definition of a team that may be applied to both

vertebrate and invertebrate societies. We reconsider what it means to work as

a team or group and suggest that there are many more teams in insect societies

than previously thought. A team task requires different subtasks to be

performed concurrently for successful completion. There is a division of labor

within a team. Contrary to previous reviews of teams in social insects, we do

not constrain teams to consist of members of different castes and argue that

team members may be interchangeable. Consequently, we suggest that a team is

simply the set of individuals that performs a team task. We contrast teams

with groups and suggest that a group task requires the simultaneous

performance and cooperation of two or more individuals for successful

completion. In a group, there is no division of labor—each individual

performs the same task. We also contrast vertebrate and invertebrate teams and

find that vertebrate teams tend to be associated with hunting and are based on

individual recognition. Invertebrate teams occur in societies characterized by

a great deal of redundancy, and we predict that teams in insect societies are

more likely to be found in large polymorphic (“complex”) societies

than in small monomorphic (“simple”) societies.},

	abstract = {In an interesting study, Cole and Wiernasz ([1][1]) recently showed that for the ant Pogonomyrmex occidentalis , colonies with high genetic diversity had a much greater growth rate and survival than did colonies with low genetic diversity. This was taken as evidence that multiple mating by queens (polyandry) and low relatedness increase colony fitness. An alternative explanation seems possible, however. Polygyny (multiple queens per nest) is common in ants and, like polyandry, reduces within-colony relatedness ([2][2], [3][3]).

Polyandry and polygyny can be distinguished by reconstructing maternal and paternal genotypes from the genotypes of many offspring per colony. Cole and Wiernasz genotyped only six offspring per colony and analyzed their data with an algorithm that only estimates the average relatedness among nestmates. The authors state that primary polygyny is extremely rare but provide no evidence that secondary polygyny (adoption of queens by established colonies) does not occur. Because polygyny mostly arises through secondary polygyny in ants ([2][2],[3][3]), reduced within-colony relatedness might result also from the presence of multiple queens per nest. If decreased relatedness were only due to multiple mating, the observed relatedness ( r = 0.32) would require an effective number of matings by queens of 7.1 ([4][4])—a value greater than the average ( Ne = 1.16, n =19) ([5][5]) and maximal ( Ne = 3.9−6.3) ([6][6]) values yet reported for ants.

Polygyny has been shown to be associated with greater colony size and higher productivity in several ant species ([7–9][7]). Moreover, the presence of multiple queens should also lower the rate of colony mortality because the risk of loss of all egg-layers is reduced. Hence, it remains to be seen whether the greater growth rate and higher survival of P. occidentalis colonies with higher genetic diversity is simply due to the presence of several queens rather than any selective advantage of low relatedness.

Response: We argued ([1][26]) that differences in colony fitness arise from differences in within-colony relatedness levels due to polyandry. The alternative explanation—that our results were due to the possibility that colonies with multiple queens may have higher productivity, growth, and survival, and also lower relatedness, than colonies with a single queen—requires that polygyny be relatively common. Although polygyny is theoretically possible in P. occidentalis , we consider it highly unlikely. All investigations of Pogonomyrmex , which has been extensively studied ([2–10][27]), have reported that single queens are, without exception, found in the genus. Observations of multiple mating, by contrast, are common ([4][28], [5][29]). In more than 2000 observations of founding queens of P. occidentalis , we have never observed multiple foundresses that were successful; founding queens are extremely aggressive to one another ([4][28], [5][29]). Of the 33 P. occidentalis colonies that have been excavated ([3][30], [10][31]), not one has revealed more than a single queen.

Genetic and morphologic considerations likewise offer little support for the multiple-queen hypothesis. One of our protein electrophoretic loci, Amylase, has five alleles. An observation of either three different homozygotes in the same colony, two different homozygotes and one heterozygote without a matching allele, or one homozygote and two different heterozygotes without a matching allele would require the assumption of more than one queen. No colony in our sample ( n = 1492) fell into these categories. (Because of the low genetic power of our electrophoretic locus, however, this should not be regarded as definitive.) Morphologically, in contrast to the dramatic variation in male dry mass, there is less within- or between-colony variation in queen size. Polygynous queens are often smaller than their monogynous counterparts ([11][32]), so the lack of size variation is suggestive. Additionally, the queen-worker thorax volume ratio is 12. In all cases in which this ratio has been greater than 5.1, the species was monogynous ([12][33]).

Because there is substantial evidence that colonies are not founded by multiple queens, the only possibility consistent with polygyny is that a colony could have multiple queens secondarily—that is, queens are added to colonies sometime later in the life cycle. During nine colony-founding episodes, we have never observed queens cofounding or attempting to enter established colonies, nor has this behavior been observed in other members of the genus ([2][27], [3][30]). On the contrary, we frequently have observed queens being excavated from their burrows and killed by workers from other colonies ([4][28], [5][29]). If secondary polygyny did occur, we would expect the intracolony relatedness to be greater in first-year colonies (that have workers from a single queen) than from older colonies; no such pattern was observed. If colonies adopt queens at some point during their life cycle, producing lower relatedness, cohorts of first-year colonies should not show an inverse correlation of relatedness and growth rate; instead, that pattern should be exhibited only by older colonies (that can be polygynous). We found, however, that the association of fast growth and low relatedness was not tied to particular cohorts or years [figure 3 of ([1][26])].

Although none of these lines of evidence is decisive in itself, in the aggregate they suggest that the standard for positing multiple queens in a colony must be high; it is not enough simply to point out their logical possibility. In view of the lack of positive evidence for the existence of polygyny—and the abundant evidence of multiple mating within this species and across the genus—we thus conclude that polygyny is an unlikely explanation for the results we observed.

Fjerdingstad and Keller also reason that because the number of effective matings by queens is greater than the number of effective matings in other monogynous species, it is unlikely that P. occidentalis forms colonies with a single queen. Given the population intracolonial relatedness ( r = 0.324), the effective number of times that the queens mate (under the assumption of a single queen) is 6.76, not 7.1, as Fjerdingstad and Keller suggest ([13][34]). As Fjerdingstad and Keller note, the highest value obtained previously is 6.3 matings, based on relatedness of 0.33 in Acromyrmex octospinosus ([14][35]). The estimate of relatedness for P. occidentalis is strikingly similar to the estimate of relatedness obtained for A. octospinosus ( r = 0.326 for 22 field colonies) ([14][35]), and the standard errors on these estimates (0.012 and 0.044, respectively) indicate that there is no statistical difference between the two. The application of sensitive genetic techniques to more species will determine whether these two species are unusual extremes or represent a category which is relatively unstudied.

Rates of predation were significantly greater in the tropics; that is, a food item was exploited by ants in significantly less time in the tropics than in the temperate zone. It was also found that predation rates were higher in low second—growth vegetation than in forests and higher on the ground than on vegetation, and that these differences were more pronounced in the temperature zone than in the tropics. Rates of predation occuring on buildings were lower than in natural situations at every latitude. The number of ant species taken at the baits increased from 22 at the northernmost locality to 74 at the southernmost. In all localities but the northernmost the forest habitat produced a greater diversity of species than the field habitat. There was greater degree of microhabitat specificity among ants in the tropics than in the temperate zone. The proportion of forest canopy specialists also increased toward the tropics. Overall predation rate and ant species richness were found to be positively correlated on a latitudinal scale, but this relationship broke down at the level of habitats and microhabitats.},

	abstract = {Ants are the most widely distributed and most numerically abundant group of social insects. First, they were ground- or litter-dwelling predators or scavengers, and certain taxa evolved to adopt an arboreal way of life. Most ant species are generalist feeders, and only some ground-nesting and ground- foraging species are strictly predators. Ants are central-place foragers (with the exception of army ants during the nomadic phase) that may use different foraging strategies. Solitary hunting is the most common method employed by predatory ants. Cooperative hunting, considered more evolved than solitary hunting, is used by army ants and other ants such as Myrmicaria opaciventris, Paratrechina longicornis or the dominant arboreal Oecophylla. Army ants are predators with different levels of specialization, some of which focus on a particular genus or species, as is the case for Nomamyrmex esenbeckii which organizes subterranean raids on the very large colonies of the leaf-cutting species Atta colombica or A. cephalotes. Arboreal ants have evolved predatory behaviors adapted to the tree foliage, where prey are unpredictable and able to escape by flying away, jumping or dropping. The weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda, for example, hunts prey diurnally in groups. They detect prey visually from a relatively long distance and the workers adhere to the plant substrate by means of very powerful adhesive pads and claws. On some occasions, during prey retrieval, the prey can be stolen by other ants; food- robbing is more frequent in ground-dwelling than in arboreal species. Many predatory ants are engaged in a kind of arms race: they have evolved morpho-physiological adaptations to foil prey defense or escape mechanisms. Mandible shapes have changed and powerful venoms have been developed by different species. Depending on their prey specialization ants can have many different mandible shapes: trap-jaw mandibles, nutcracker mandibles adapted to hunting long prey, pitch-fork mandibles, falciform mandibles and long mandibles. Other ant species are specialized in hunting a certain prey type, but do not have a mandible shape particular to that specialization; these species are egg predators, collembolan predators, or social insect predators. Some ant species are either specialized or occasional termite predators. All of these ants play a role in the equilibrium of ground- and litter-dwelling detritivorous arthropods and the herbivorous insects living in these strata.},

	abstract = {Animals assess many factors when choosing how aggressively to behave during interspecific competitive interactions. Aggressive behaviour can help win resources, but it can also be costly. Here we tested how context such as competitor familiarity, habitat type and resource value affect competitive behaviour using two ant species, Formica xerophila and F. integroides. We found that competitive encounters within an individual's territory yielded more aggressive interactions than encounters in a neutral arena, and aggression towards competitors increased with resource value. Using a recently developed design combining behaviour assays between live ant dyads and ants paired with glass beads chemically resembling competitors, we isolated an individual's behaviour during an encounter to show that its behaviour can be significantly affected by the behaviour of its competitor during the interaction. Furthermore, we determined that context can affect each species differently, and that these differences are consistent with differences in overall fighting abilities. Formica integroides from trees (but not from nests) behaved differently towards live and artificial F. xerophila. Formica integroides are behaviourally dominant, which facilitates a strategy wherein individuals aggressively defend the nest but reciprocate the behaviours of their opponents (showing an interspecific Tit-for-Tat strategy) when defending less valuable locations. Formica xerophila are generally submissive, which favours a highly context-dependent strategy. In particular, F. xerophila discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar F. integroides, and behave more aggressively towards foreign competitors than towards neighbouring competitors. Differences between species’ behaviours suggest that these interspecific interactions are dynamic context-dependent associations that cannot be reduced to a static dominance hierarchy.},

	abstract = {An ant supercolony is a very large entity with very many queens. Although normal colonies of small extent and few queens remain distinct, a supercolony is integrated harmoniously over a large area 1, 2. The lack of aggression is advantageous: Aggression is costly, involving direct and indirect losses and recognition errors 3, 4. Indeed, supercolonial ants are among the ecologically most successful organisms 5, 6, 7. But how supercolonies arise remains mysterious 1, 2, 8. Suggestions include that reduced within-colony relatedness or reduced self-nonself discrimination would foster supercolony formation 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12. However, one risks confusing correlation and causality in deducing the evolution from distinct colonies to supercolonies when observing established supercolonies. It might help to follow up observations of another lack of aggression, that between single-queened colonies in some ant species. We show that the single-queened Lasius austriacus lacks aggression between colonies and occasionally integrates workers across colonies but maintains high within-colony relatedness and self-nonself discrimination. Provided that the ecological framework permits, reduced aggression might prove adaptive for any ant colony irrespective of within-colony relatedness. Abandoning aggression while maintaining discrimination might be a first stage in supercolony formation. This adds to the emphasis of ecology as central to the evolution of cooperation in general [13].},

@book{keeley_war_1996,
	title = {War {Before} {Civilization}},
	isbn = {978-0-19-511912-1},
	abstract = {The myth of the peace-loving "noble savage" is persistent and pernicious. Indeed, for the last fifty years, most popular and scholarly works have agreed that prehistoric warfare was rare, harmless, unimportant, and, like smallpox, a disease of civilized societies alone. Prehistoric warfare, according to this view, was little more than a ritualized game, where casualties were limited and the effects of aggression relatively mild. Lawrence Keeley's groundbreaking War Before Civilization offers a devastating rebuttal to such comfortable myths and debunks the notion that warfare was introduced to primitive societies through contact with civilization (an idea he denounces as "the pacification of the past"). Building on much fascinating archeological and historical research and offering an astute comparison of warfare in civilized and prehistoric societies, from modern European states to the Plains Indians of North America, War Before Civilization convincingly demonstrates that prehistoric warfare was in fact more deadly, more frequent, and more ruthless than modern war. To support this point, Keeley provides a wide-ranging look at warfare and brutality in the prehistoric world. He reveals, for instance, that prehistorical tactics favoring raids and ambushes, as opposed to formal battles, often yielded a high death-rate; that adult males falling into the hands of their enemies were almost universally killed; and that surprise raids seldom spared even women and children. Keeley cites evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world, including the discovery in South Dakota of a prehistoric mass grave containing the remains of over 500 scalped and mutilated men, women, and children (a slaughter that took place a century and a half before the arrival of Columbus). In addition, Keeley surveys the prevalence of looting, destruction, and trophy-taking in all kinds of warfare and again finds little moral distinction between ancient warriors and civilized armies. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he examines the evidence of cannibalism among some preliterate peoples. Keeley is a seasoned writer and his book is packed with vivid, eye-opening details (for instance, that the homicide rate of prehistoric Illinois villagers may have exceeded that of the modern United States by some 70 times). But he also goes beyond grisly facts to address the larger moral and philosophical issues raised by his work. What are the causes of war? Are human beings inherently violent? How can we ensure peace in our own time? Challenging some of our most dearly held beliefs, Keeley's conclusions are bound to stir controversy.},

	abstract = {"Accurst be he that first invented war," wrote Christopher Marlowe--a declaration that most of us would take as a literary, not literal, construction. But in this sweeping overview of the rise of civilization, Robert O'Connell finds that war is indeed an invention--an institution that arose due to very specific historical circumstances, an institution that now verges on extinction. In Ride of the Second Horseman, O'Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmental structure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistence patterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O'Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500 BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependent upon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves were taken to provide labor. O'Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively and pragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in a culture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O'Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did. Fascinating and provocative, Ride of the Second Horseman offers a far-reaching tour of human history that suggests the age-old cycle of war may now be near its end.},

	abstract = {How do ant colonies get anything done, when no one is in charge? An ant colony operates without a central control or hierarchy, and no ant directs another. Instead, ants decide what to do based on the rate, rhythm, and pattern of individual encounters and interactions--resulting in a dynamic network that coordinates the functions of the colony. Ant Encounters provides a revealing and accessible look into ant behavior from this complex systems perspective. Focusing on the moment-to-moment behavior of ant colonies, Deborah Gordon investigates the role of interaction networks in regulating colony behavior and relations among ant colonies. She shows how ant behavior within and between colonies arises from local interactions of individuals, and how interaction networks develop as a colony grows older and larger. The more rapidly ants react to their encounters, the more sensitively the entire colony responds to changing conditions. Gordon explores whether such reactive networks help a colony to survive and reproduce, how natural selection shapes colony networks, and how these structures compare to other analogous complex systems. Ant Encounters sheds light on the organizational behavior, ecology, and evolution of these diverse and ubiquitous social insects.},

	isbn = {978-0-684-85733-6},
	shorttitle = {Ants at {Work}},
	abstract = {A scientific tour de force, Deborah Gordon's "Ants at Work" takes us to the amazing world of an ant society and reveals a new and original understanding of how these tiny animals get the work of the colony done. Gordon's surprising and deceptively simple message that the queen is not in charge represents a fundamental shift in modern biology. It is no less than a revolution in our thinking on the mystery of natural organization.  Based on the author's seventeen years of research on harvester ants in the Arizona desert, "Ants at Work" overturns all standard ideas of insect society hierarchy. Gordon shows that an ant colony operates without any central control and that no ant has power over another. Yet the ant colony, harmoniously performs extremely complex tasks; including nest building, navigation, foraging, food storage, tending the young, garbage collection, and on occasion, even war. She shows that there are no territorial borders in the way we understand them because ants are always ready to change. Ants also switch from one task to another, which undermines the standard view that insect societies are run on a caste system. Gordon explores how ants use simple, local information to make the decisions that generate the complex behavior of colonies. New colonies are born, struggle to occupy a foraging area, grow larger, start to reproduce, and then settle in among their lifelong neighbors.  Superb drawings of ants and maps directly from Gordon's field notes enrich the experience of reading this breakthrough work. In these maps we discover what ants do when a neighboring colony disappears behind an enclosure and what they do when their neighbors suddenly reappear. We seewhere different tasks of ant daily life are performed. Through Gordon's wry sense of humor and lucid voice, we experience the delights and frustrations of spending blistering days in the desert between the Chiricahua and Peloncillo mountains of Arizona, pursuing the mystery of the fascinating behavior of "Pogonomyrmex."  By focusing on chaotic patterns of behavior instead of searching for fixed universal laws, Gordon signals the future of scientific investigation.

Eusocial insects live in highly organized societies where groups of individuals carry out specific tasks; for example, caring for the eggs, cleaning the nest, or foraging, which might suggest the presence of an advanced form of organization, similar to what might be expected from more cognitively advanced species. Mersch et al. (p. 1090, published online 18 April) tracked individual ant movements and interactions to show that their precise social organization results from temporal changes in the spatial location of workers. As they aged, ants largely progressed from being nurses located near the queen, to nest cleaners who move throughout the colony, and finally to foragers moving in and out at the colony edges.
Ants live in organized societies with a marked division of labor among workers, but little is known about how this division of labor is generated. We used a tracking system to continuously monitor individually tagged workers in six colonies of the ant Camponotus fellah over 41 days. Network analyses of more than 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within groups than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals allowed us to calculate the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions. These values suggest that the network of interaction within colonies is primarily mediated by age-induced changes in the spatial location of workers.
Monitoring of individually tagged worker ants revealed three distinct groups that greatly differ in behavior.

For each area we discuss the basis for conflict (potential conflict), whether conflict is expressed (actual conflict), whose interests prevail (conflict outcome), and the factors that reduce colony-level costs of conflict (conflict resolution), such as factors that cause workers to work rather than to lay eggs. Reproductive conflicts are widespread, sometimes having dramatic effects on the colony. However, three key factors (kinship, coercion, and constraint) typically combine to limit the effects of reproductive conflict and often lead to complete resolution.},

	abstract = {More than a century ago, William Morton Wheeler proposed that social insect colonies can be regarded as superorganisms when they have morphologically differentiated reproductive and nursing castes that are analogous to the metazoan germ-line and soma. Following the rise of sociobiology in the 1970s, Wheeler's insights were largely neglected, and we were left with multiple new superorganism concepts that are mutually inconsistent and uninformative on how superorganismality originated. These difficulties can be traced to the broadened sociobiological concept of eusociality, which denies that physical queen–worker caste differentiation is a universal hallmark of superorganismal colonies. Unlike early evolutionary naturalists and geneticists such as Weismann, Huxley, Fisher and Haldane, who set out to explain the acquisition of an unmated worker caste, the goal of sociobiology was to understand the evolution of eusociality, a broad-brush convenience category that covers most forms of cooperative breeding. By lumping a diverse spectrum of social systems into a single category, and drawing attention away from the evolution of distinct quantifiable traits, the sociobiological tradition has impeded straightforward connections between inclusive fitness theory and the major evolutionary transitions paradigm for understanding irreversible shifts to higher organizational complexity. We evaluate the history by which these inconsistencies accumulated, develop a common-cause approach for understanding the origins of all major transitions in eukaryote hierarchical complexity, and use Hamilton's rule to argue that they are directly comparable. We show that only Wheeler's original definition of superorganismality can be unambiguously linked to irreversible evolutionary transitions from context-dependent reproductive altruism to unconditional differentiation of permanently unmated castes in the ants, corbiculate bees, vespine wasps and higher termites. We argue that strictly monogamous parents were a necessary, albeit not sufficient condition for all transitions to superorganismality, analogous to single-zygote bottlenecking being a necessary but not sufficient condition for the convergent origins of complex soma across multicellular eukaryotes. We infer that conflict reduction was not a necessary condition for the origin of any of these major transitions, and conclude that controversies over the status of inclusive fitness theory primarily emanate from the arbitrarily defined sociobiological concepts of superorganismality and eusociality, not from the theory itself.},

	abstract = {Social insect workers can increase their inclusive fitness by increasing colony production of reproductives, by manipulating the identity of colony reproductives in favor of individuals with greater kin-value (e.g. relatedness) to themselves, or both. The manipulative option results from the non-clonal genetic structure of insect societies and necessarily introduces conflict into insect societies. This paper examines conflict over male production, queen-rearing, and sex allocation for monogynous hymenopteran societies. The structure of conflict is shown to vary according to the particular conflict, queen mating frequency, and other factors. Importantly, there are conditions under which the actual conflict (i.e. the actual manipulation of reproduction) is predicted to be markedly less than the potential conflict (i.e. all the manipulations potentially beneficial to individual workers given the kin-value asymmetries within the colony). For example, when manipulation is costly (i.e. reduces colony productivity), or relatively ineffective (i.e. because of limitations to kin recognition ability, or counter manipulations such as worker policing) it may be selectively disfavored. Furthermore, low actual conflict may be characteristic of certain sub-sets of workers (e.g. foragers) or certain phases of colony growth (e.g. the ergonomic phase). As a result, a pluralistic rather than a typological perspective on conflict in insect societies is suggested. Low actual conflict may facilitate the evolution of colony- or group-level adaptations (i.e. attributes of individuals which have evolved to enable them to function synergistically as a colony or group, such as social foraging in honey bees and army ants), despite the non-clonal genetic structure of most insect societies. However, low levels of actual conflict between individuals need not result in group-level adaptations. The term community of interest is suggested to describe groups within which there is little or no actual conflict, whether or not group-level adaptations occur. The recently revived term superorganism is problematic, because it is often used in a categorical way, to describe whole societies. This difficulty is partly overcome by the pluralistic outlook, which would favor statements such as “foraging in the honey bee shows superorganismic properties” (i.e. group-level adaptations), rather than typological thinking such as “the honey bee colony is a superorganism”.},

We quantify the degree to which colonies of different sizes exhibit division of labor, and what proportion tends to be inactive, in the ant Temnothorax albipennis. Colony size neither influenced individual specialization nor overall division of labor in this species and larger colonies did not show a higher proportion of inactive workers. Interestingly, small colonies seemed to rely more on a small number of high-performance workers: the proportion of work performed by the single most active worker is significantly higher in smaller colonies for several tasks. More research is needed to resolve when and how colony size affects collective organization and division of labor in insect colonies.},

	abstract = {The advanced colonial state of eusociality has evolved in insects as a defense of nest sites within foraging distance of persistent food sources. In the Hymenoptera, the final step in the approach to eusociality is through a suite of preadaptations comprising simultaneous provisioning, fidelity to the nest, and a preexisting propensity toward dominance behavior and the selection of tasks according to opportunity. The only genetic change needed to cross the threshold to the eusocial grade is the foundress's possession of an allele that holds the foundress and her offspring to the nest. The preadaptations provide the phenotypic flexibility required for eusociality, as well as the key emergent traits arising from interactions of the group members. Group (colony-level) selection then immediately acts on both of these traits. The rarity of the origin of eusociality is evidently due to the rarity of the combination of progressive provisioning with environments of the kind that give an edge to group selection over individual direct selection, causing offspring to stay at the natal nest rather than disperse. Several lines of evidence, examined here, suggest that collateral kin selection does not play a significant role.},

Recent studies have revealed how small-scale interactions among ants amplify to create large-scale traffic structure, such as segregation of counterflows. However, much less is known about the ecological costs and benefits of different kinds of traffic organization. The common assumption that maximum traffic flux provides maximum ecological benefit needs closer scrutiny.

One of the most important factors is probably the availability of suitable empty nest sites. By population censuses, laboratory experiments, and microsatellite analyses, we investigated the colony and population structure of the small, myrmicine ant Leptothorax (Myrafant) nylanderi in a deciduous forest near Wurzburg, Germany, where nest sites appear to be strongly limited, especially in late summer. Colonies of L. nylanderi inhabit cavities in rotting branches, hollow acorns, grass stems, etc. After hibernation, a temporary overabundance of empty nest sites facilitates the fragmentation of larger colonies into smaller buds, which, because the species is monogynous, are in part queenless. Nest sites become scarce in summer due to rapid decay, and both established colonies and young founding queens face a severe shortage of suitable nest sites. This leads to the fusion of established, unrelated colonies, which after initial fighting permanently merge and live together. Typically only one queen survives after fusion. Similarly, young mated queens may seek adoption in alien nests instead of founding their own colonies solitarily, and here again only a single queen survives. This temporary intraspecific parasitism may be an important first step in the evolution of obligatory permanent parasitism, which is widespread in the genus Leptothorax.},

Self-organisation underlies many collective processes in large animal groups, where coordinated patterns and activities emerge at the group level from local interactions among its members. Although the importance of key individuals acting as effective leaders has recently been recognised in certain collective processes, it is widely believed that self-organised decisions are evenly shared among all or a subset of individuals acting as decision-makers, unless there are significant conflicts of interests among group members. Here, we show that certain individuals are disproportionately influential in self-organised decisions in a system where all individuals share the same interests: nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax albipennis. Workers that visited a good available nest site prior to emigration (the familiar nest) memorised its location, and later used this memory to navigate efficiently and find that nest faster than through random exploration. Additionally, these workers relied on their private information to expedite individual decisions about the familiar nest. This conferred a bias in favour of familiar nests over novel nests during emigrations. Informed workers were shown to have a significantly greater share in both recruitment and transport to the familiar nest than naïve workers. This suggests that they were the main determinants of the collective preference for familiar nests, and thus contributed greatly to enhance collective performance. Overall, these results indicate that self-organised decisions are not always evenly shared among decision-makers, even in systems where there are no conflicts of interest. Animal groups may instead benefit from well-informed, knowledgeable individuals acting as leaders in decisions.},

The book begins with a global perspective on species diversity in time and space and explores interactions at the community level before describing the population ecology of these social insects. The final section covers the recent ecological phenomenon of invasive ants: how they move across the globe, invade, affect ecosystems, and are managed by humans. Each chapter links ant ecology to broader ecological principles, provides a succinct summary, and discusses future research directions. Practical aspects of myrmecology, applications of ant ecology, debates, and novel discoveries are highlighted in text boxes throughout the volume.

As a result of this lack of information, invertebrate taxa are often left out of both large-scale analyses of biodiversity patterns and large-scale efforts in conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we introduce the first comprehensive global database of ant species distributions, the Global Ant Biodiversity Informatics (GABI) database, based on the compilation of 1.72 million records extracted from over 8811 publications and 25 existing databases. We first present the main goals of the database, the methodology used to build the database, as well as its limitations and challenges. Then, we discuss how different fields of ant biology may benefit from utilizing this tool. Finally, we emphasize the importance of future participation of myrmecologists to improve the database and use it to identify and fill holes in our knowledge of ant biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Predators of highly defensive prey likely develop cost-reducing adaptations. The ant Megaponera analis is a specialized termite predator, solely raiding termites of the subfamily Macrotermitinae (in this study, mostly colonies of Pseudocanthotermes sp.) at their foraging sites. The evolutionary arms race between termites and ants led to various defensive mechanisms in termites (for example, a caste specialized in fighting predators). Because M. analis incurs high injury/mortality risks when preying on termites, some risk-mitigating adaptations seem likely to have evolved. We show that a unique rescue behavior in M. analis, consisting of injured nestmates being carried back to the nest, reduces combat mortality. After a fight, injured ants are carried back by their nestmates; these ants have usually lost an extremity or have termites clinging to them and are able to recover within the nest. Injured ants that are forced experimentally to return without help, die in 32\% of the cases. Behavioral experiments show that two compounds, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, present in the mandibular gland reservoirs, trigger the rescue behavior. A model accounting for this rescue behavior identifies the drivers favoring its evolution and estimates that rescuing enables maintenance of a 28.7\% larger colony size. Our results are the first to explore experimentally the adaptive value of this form of rescue behavior focused on injured nestmates in social insects and help us to identify evolutionary drivers responsible for this type of behavior to evolve in animals.
Ants that get injured during predation on termites get saved by their nestmates and recover inside the nest.

As tightly integrated units that vary greatly in size, eusocial insect colonies, in particular, are expected to exhibit social scaling relations. To address the question of how social organization scales with colony size, we quantified task performance in variably sized colonies of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus. We found a positive scaling relationship between colony size and division of labor in 2 different contexts. First, individual workers were more specialized in older, larger colonies. Second, division of labor increased with colony size, independently of colony age. Moreover, the proportional allocation of workers to tasks shifted during colony ontogeny—older, larger colonies performed relatively less brood care—but did not vary with colony size among same-aged colonies. There were no colony-size effects on per capita activity or the distribution of activity across workers. Size-related changes in task performance were correlated with changes in the rate of encounter between nest mates. These results highlight the importance of colony size for the organization of work in insect societies and raise broader questions about the role of size in sociobiology.},

The size–complexity hypothesis proposes that, as larger colonies evolve, both non-reproductive and reproductive division of labour become more complex as workers and queens act to maximize inclusive fitness. Using a statistically robust phylogenetic comparative analysis of social and environmental traits of species within the ant tribe Attini, we show that colony size is positively related to both non-reproductive (worker size variation) and reproductive (queen–worker dimorphism) division of labour. The results also suggested that colony size acts on non-reproductive and reproductive division of labour in different ways. Environmental factors, including measures of variation in temperature and precipitation, had no significant effects on any division of labour measure or colony size. Overall, these results support the size–complexity hypothesis for the evolution of social complexity and division of labour in eusocial insects. Determining the evolutionary drivers of colony size may help contribute to our understanding of the evolution of social complexity.},

In large colonies, old workers spent significantly more time foraging than young workers did, while young workers spent more time caring for brood. In small colonies, young and old workers spent a similar amount of time foraging and caring for brood. This difference in task allocation patterns in large and small colonies was associated with a difference in contact rates between workers.

	abstract = {The broad limits of mature colony size in social insect species are likely to be set by ecological factors. However, any change in colony size has a number of important social consequences. The most fundamental is a change in the expected reproductive potential of workers. If colony size rises, workers experience a fall in their chances of becoming replacement reproductives and, it is shown, increasing selection for mutual inhibition of one another's reproduction (worker policing). As workers’ reproductive potential falls, the degree of dimorphism between reproductive and worker castes (morphological skew) can rise. This helps explain why small societies have low morphological skew and tend to be simple in organization, whereas large societies have high morphological skew and tend to be complex. The social consequences of change in colony size may also alter colony size itself in a process of positive feedback. For these reasons, small societies should be characterized by intense, direct conflict over reproduction and caste determination. By contrast, conflict in large societies should predominantly be over brood composition, and members of these societies should be relatively compliant to manipulation of their caste. Colony size therefore deserves fuller recognition as a key determinant, along with kin structure, of social complexity, the reproductive potential of helpers, the degree of caste differentiation, and the nature of within-group conflict.},

	abstract = {Intracolonial conflict among ant workers can establish a reproductive hierarchy, with top-ranking individuals often securing oviposition opportunities. Here we show that in the ant Odontomachus brunneus, reproduction-based dominance interactions control worker movement and location, and that this, in turn, mechanistically governs task allocation within the colony and establishes a division of labour for nonreproductive tasks. Movement made by a worker towards the brood is mostly preceded by winning a pairwise dominance interaction, and movement away from the brood is mostly preceded by losing a pairwise interaction. Consequently, workers are distributed within the colony such that the more subordinate the individual, the more peripheral her location with respect to the reproductive centre of the nest. Behavioural roles are naturally restricted to particular zones of the colony, therefore, allocation to a particular zone, through dominance interaction, ensures role specialization. This represents a new organizational mechanism, which we call ‘interaction-based task allocation’. In characterizing the dominance interactions of this species, we also identify two new behaviours: (1) ‘subordinate driving’, which involves a dominant individual physically manoeuvring a subordinate, by way of continued aggression, away from the reproductive centre of the nest; and (2) ‘antennal shivering’, which describes the antennal movements made by a subordinate immediately preceding and during subordinate driving.},

Recent work with the ant genus Cephalotes has provided new comparative evidence that ecological specialization may drive adaptive caste specialization. Here, three key predictions of this adaptive hypothesis are supported, using a representative of the highest level of ecological specialization and the most specialized soldier phenotype. First, soldier defensive performance was maximal for the specific nesting resource used most often in nature. Second, colonies only used a specialized subset of available nesting resources and preferred the specific resource that maximizes soldier performance. Third, soldier performance and its limitations on resource use were found to have both direct and indirect consequences for colony reproduction. These findings suggest that the most specialized soldier phenotype in Cephalotes is indeed an adaptation to ecological specialization on a narrowly defined subset of available nesting resources.},

Adaptation and regulation of the sterile caste, to a certain extent, drives the evolution of eusociality. Depending on adaptive functions of the first evolved sterile caste, eusocial societies can be categorized into the worker-first and soldier-first lineages, respectively. The former is marked by a worker caste as the first evolved altruistic caste, whose primary function is housekeeping, and the latter is highlighted by a sterile soldier caste as the first evolved altruistic caste, whose task is predominantly colony defense. The apparent functional differences between these two fundamentally important castes suggest worker-first and soldier-first eusociality are potentially driven by a suite of distinctively different factors. Current studies of eusocial evolution have been focused largely on the worker-first Hymenoptera, whereas understanding of soldier-first lineages including termites, eusocial aphids, gall-dwelling thrips, and snapping shrimp, is greatly lacking. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on biology, morphology, adaptive functions, and caste regulation of the soldier caste. In addition, we discuss the biological, ecological and genetic factors that might contribute to the evolution of distinct caste systems within eusocial lineages.},

	abstract = {I investigate a social parasitism by examining the lives the parasite involved. I use a variety of techniques to understand the population genetics, host acquisition behaviors, and space-use of an obligate parasitic ant (Polyergus mexicanus) that conducts raids to steal the brood of its host species (several Formica spp.) and makes them “slave” workers in the parasite’s nest. I consider the interacting roles of intraspecific competition, kinship, and host specialization on each of these topics.In Chapter 1, I use microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of the parasite population at three scales: subpopulations, neighboring nests, and among nestmates. I find that there are three very distinct subpopulations that often predict host-use patterns, but not always. Neighboring nests are sometimes closely related, enabling potential kin selection. Lastly, parasite nestmates are overwhelmingly full siblings, yet there were numerous nestmates that must have come from different parents, suggesting that raiding parasites may also steal conspecific brood for enslavement.In Chapter 2, I characterize raids from an optimal foraging perspective. I found that parasitic colonies that send more raiders further distances obtain more brood on their raids. Nests that are capable of larger raids in general had a higher success rate, and more variability in raid sizes, but not distances. These findings suggest that raids are tailored to the expected quality of the host nest target, and that larger nests have more flexibility in their raiding tactics.In Chapter 3, I investigate intraspecific competition, aggression, and territoriality among parasites by looking at the spatial arrangement of P. mexicanus nests and raids relative to their conspecific neighbors and their host species. I found that nests were often overdispersed, a classic sign of intraspecific competition. However, contrary to my predictions, raids from neighboring nests that shared host species overlapped more than those that used different host species. Overall, these spatial results suggest that competition among parasites may play out at different life stages, and that the specific identity of host species might determine the nature of conspecific parasitic interactions.This work documents the complexity and far-reaching implications of parasite-parasite interactions.},

	abstract = {Despite their reputation for building fortress-like colonies, ants and other social insects have many natural enemies that can infiltrate and exploit them. This profitable strategy, which allows individuals to reap collective benefits while paying few costs of cooperation, has evolved repeatedly in ants. Here, we review recent advances in the study of social parasitism, with three goals: (1) consider how social parasitism arises within the ants, (2) examine the exploitative and defensive tactics employed by parasites and hosts at each stage of their interactions, and (3) integrate recent social parasite species discoveries into an overview of the biogeographic distribution of social parasites. We focus on three common types of interspecific social parasitism: temporary, queen-killing parasites, permanent inquilines (which are usually, but not always, queen-tolerant), and dulotic species that steal heterospecific brood to build their own workforce. We consider only superficially intraspecific interactions and interspecific associations that appear to walk the line between commensal and parasitic. Through our classification of the components of social parasite evolution and our updated assessment of social parasite biogeography, we identify several knowledge gaps in the field and close with some proposed strategies and priorities for future research.Open access, licensed under CC BY 4.0. © 2020 The Author(s).DOI: 10.25849/myrmecol.news\_030:053Pages: 53-71Volume: 30Year: 2020Journal: Myrmecol.

We review ultimate factors underlying variation in life history strategies in female social insects, whose social life reshapes common trade-offs, such as the one between fecundity and longevity. Interspecific life history variation is associated with colony size, mediated by changes in division of labour and extrinsic mortality. In addition to the ratio of juvenile to adult mortality, social factors such as queen number influence life history trajectories. We discuss two hypotheses explaining why queen fecundity and lifespan is higher in single-queen societies and suggest further research directions on the evolution of life history variation in social insects.},

These territorial battles could influence the spatial distribution of nests and therefore the success of founding by newly mated queens.

Here, we report the discovery of high-magnesium calcite [CaMg(CO3)2] armor overlaying the exoskeletons of major workers of the leaf-cutter ant Acromyrmex echinatior. Live-rearing and in vitro synthesis experiments indicate that the biomineral layer accumulates rapidly as ant workers mature, that the layer is continuously distributed, covering nearly the entire integument, and that the ant epicuticle catalyzes biomineral nucleation and growth. In situ nanoindentation demonstrates that the biomineral layer significantly hardens the exoskeleton. Increased survival of ant workers with biomineralized exoskeletons during aggressive encounters with other ants and reduced infection by entomopathogenic fungi demonstrate the protective role of the biomineral layer. The discovery of biogenic high-magnesium calcite in the relatively well-studied leaf-cutting ants suggests that calcareous biominerals enriched in magnesium may be more common in metazoans than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {The great evolutionary success of insects is partly linked to the innovation of the cuticle, which underlies a complex exoskeleton with varied functions. Cuticle development is costly because chitin and cuticular proteins require ingested nitrogen. Studying cuticle thickness on a comparative basis allows insight into the trade-off between offspring quality and quantity. This trade-off takes a particular meaning in ant workers because they are wingless, non-dispersers and generally sterile. We selected a comprehensive sample of 42 ant species (40 genera belonging to nine subfamilies) and measured cuticle thickness in workers using labour-intensive histological sectioning of the prothorax. Thickness varied substantially across genera, ranging from 1.3 to 109.8 µm. We correlated thickness with body size, measured as head width. Our results show a strong influence of body size, but also phylogeny, because workers in ‘formicoid’ species tend to have a thinner cuticle (two exceptions). The effect of body size is also obvious in species having size-polymorphic workers. We discuss the idea that a thinner cuticle is associated with miniaturization of workers, and its ecological consequences are buffered in a social environment. We reveal that the bulk of ant species have a very thin cuticle, and this represents cost savings that may partly underlie the massive increase in colony size during adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {Group size in both multicellular organisms and animal societies can correlate with the degree of division of labour. For ants, the task specialization hypothesis (TSH) proposes that increased behavioural specialization enabled by larger group size corresponds to anatomical specialization of worker brains. Alternatively, the social brain hypothesis proposes that increased levels of social stimuli in larger colonies lead to enlarged brain regions in all workers, regardless of their task specialization. We tested these hypotheses in acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola), which exhibit behavioural but not morphological task specialization. In wild colonies, we marked, followed and tested ant workers involved in foraging tasks on the leaves (leaf-ants) and in defensive tasks on the host tree trunk (trunk-ants). Task specialization increased with colony size, especially in defensive tasks. The relationship between colony size and brain region volume was task-dependent, supporting the TSH. Specifically, as colony size increased, the relative size of regions within the mushroom bodies of the brain decreased in trunk-ants but increased in leaf-ants; those regions play important roles in learning and memory. Our findings suggest that workers specialized in defence may have reduced learning abilities relative to leaf-ants; these inferences remain to be tested. In societies with monomorphic workers, brain polymorphism enhanced by group size could be a mechanism by which division of labour is achieved.},

We studied whether the presentation of an O. smaragdina ant on the comb releases a specific behavioral response of the bees. After the exposure of a living O. smaragdina worker, held by a forceps on the top of the A. florea comb, the number of bees at the sticky band zone increased and remained on higher level for 2 hours compared to control experiments (presentation of an empty forceps, Tenebrio molitor larva or another arboreal ant species, Crematogaster rogenhoferi). Further, more sticky material was deposited by the bees after exposure of a weaver ant. This behavior seems to be a specific reaction of A. florea to its most important predator O. smaragdina.},

	abstract = {Altruistic behavior, in which one individual provides aid to another at some cost to itself, is well documented. However, some species engage in a form of altruism, called rescue, that places the altruist in immediate danger. Here we investigate one such example, namely rescuing victims captured by predators. In a field experiment with two North American ant species, Tetramorium sp. E and Prenolepis imparis, individuals were held in artificial snares simulating capture. T. sp. E, but not P. imparis, exhibited digging, pulling, and snare biting, the latter precisely targeted to the object binding the victim. These results are the first to document precision rescue in a North American ant species; moreover, unlike rescue in other ants, T. sp. E rescues conspecifics from different colonies, mirroring their atypical social behavior, namely the lack of aggression between non-nestmate (heterocolonial) conspecifics. In a second, observational study designed to demonstrate rescue from an actual predator, T. sp. E victims were dropped into an antlion's pit and the behavior of a single rescuer was observed. Results showed that T. sp. E not only attempted to release the victim, but also risked attacking the predator, suggesting that precision rescue may play an important role in this species' antipredator behavior.},

	abstract = {Insects and fungi have a shared history of association in common habitats where together they endure similar environmental conditions, but only recently have mycologists and entomologists recognized and had the techniques to study the intricacies of some of the associations. This new volume covers "seven wonders of the insect-fungus world" for which exciting new results have become available, often due to the use of new methods that include phylogenetic analysis and development of molecular markers. Eleven chapters of the volume are presented in two sections, "Fungi that act against insects" and "Fungi mutualistic with insects" that cover a number of major themes. Examples of necrotrophic parasites of insects are discussed, not only for biological control potential, but also as organisms with population structure and complex multipartite interactions; a beneficial role for symptomless endophytes in broad-leafed plants is proposed; biotrophic fungal parasites with reduced morphologies are placed among relatives using phylogenetic methods; complex methods of fungal spore dispersal include interactions with one or more arthropods; the farming behavior of New World attine ants is compared with that of humans and the Old World fungus-growing termites; certain mycophagous insects use fungi as a sole nutritional resource; and other insects obtain nutritional supplements from yeasts. Insects involved in fungal associations include--but are not limited to--members of the Coleoptera, Diptera, Homoptera, Hymenoptera, and Isoptera. The fungi involved in interactions with insects may be clustered taxonomically, as is the case for Ascomycetes in the Hypocreales (e.g., Beauveria, Metarhizium, Fusarium), ambrosia fungi in the genera ophiostoma and ceratocystis and their asexual relatives, Laboulbeniomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and the more basal Microsporidia. Other groups, however, have only occasional members (e.g., mushrooms cultivated by attine ants and termites) in such associations. The chapters included in this volume constitute a modern crash course in the study of insect-fungus associations.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a specialized form of symbiosis that is known to have evolved in only four animal groups: humans, bark beetles, termites, and ants. Here, we reconstruct the major evolutionary transitions that produced the five distinct agricultural systems of the fungus-growing ants, the most well studied of the nonhuman agriculturalists. We do so with reference to the first fossil-calibrated, multiple-gene, molecular phylogeny that incorporates the full range of taxonomic diversity within the fungus-growing ant tribe Attini. Our analyses indicate that the original form of ant agriculture, the cultivation of a diverse subset of fungal species in the tribe Leucocoprineae, evolved ≈50 million years ago in the Neotropics, coincident with the early Eocene climatic optimum. During the past 30 million years, three known ant agricultural systems, each involving a phylogenetically distinct set of derived fungal cultivars, have separately arisen from the original agricultural system. One of these derived systems subsequently gave rise to the fifth known system of agriculture, in which a single fungal species is cultivated by leaf-cutter ants. Leaf-cutter ants evolved remarkably recently (≈8–12 million years ago) to become the dominant herbivores of the New World tropics. Our analyses identify relict, extant attine ant species that occupy phylogenetic positions that are transitional between the agricultural systems. Intensive study of those species holds particular promise for clarifying the sequential accretion of ecological and behavioral characters that produced each of the major ant agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {In the ant Pheidole bicarinata, adult soldiers suppress the induction of soldier developments in larvae that have been treated with methoprene, as well as in acetone-treated controls. Induction of soldier development is inhibited in methoprene-treated larvae when the adult soldiers are present as nurses, when they are present in the colony but minor workers serve as nurses, and when they are held in a minor worker-permeable cage to prevent them from contacting larvae. Suppression of soldier determination can be overridden by high doses of methoprene applied during the juvenile hormone-sensitive period for soldier determination. The degree of suppression increases with increasing contact between larvae and adult soldiers. The most likely mechanism of inhibition is a contact soldier pheromone. On the basis of our results, we expand our model of soldier determination to accommodate the fact that the threshold titre of juvenile hormone necessary to induce soldier development changes in the presence of soldiers. A threshold that is sensitive to the presence of adult soldiers provides a mechanism whereby the worker caste ratio in colonies can be regulated.},

The role of the brains of individual ants in generating division of labor, however, is poorly understood, as is the degree to which interspecific variation in worker social phenotypes is underscored by functional neurobiological differentiation. Here we demonstrate that dimorphic minor and major workers of different ages from three ecotypical species of the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole have distinct patterns of neuropil size variation. Brain subregions involved in sensory input (optic and antennal lobes), sensory integration, learning and memory (mushroom bodies), and motor functions (central body and subesophageal ganglion) vary significantly in relative size, reflecting differential investment in neuropils that likely regulate subcaste- and age-correlated task performance. Worker groups differ in brain size and display patterns of altered isometric and allometric subregion scaling that affect brain architecture independently of brain size variation. In particular, mushroom body size was positively correlated with task plasticity in the context of both age- and subcaste-related polyethism, providing strong, novel support that greater investment in this neuropil increases behavioral flexibility. Our findings reveal striking levels of developmental plasticity and evolutionary flexibility in Pheidole worker neuroanatomy, supporting the hypothesis that mosaic alterations of brain composition contribute to adaptive colony structure and interspecific variation in social organization.},

The first group are sometimes calledrealists. The second group are pacifists. The task of just war theoryis to seek a middle path between them: to justify at least some wars,but also to limit them (Ramsey 1961). Although realism undoubtedly hasits adherents, few philosophers find it compelling.[2] The real challenge to just war theory comes from pacifism. And weshould remember, from the outset, that this challenge is real. Thejustified war might well be a chimera., However, this entry explores the middle path between realism andpacifism. It begins by outlining the central substantive divide incontemporary just war theory, before introducing the methodologicalschisms underpinning that debate. It then discusses the moral evaluationof wars as a whole, and of individual acts within war (traditionally,though somewhat misleadingly, called jus ad bellum andjus in bello respectively).},

Here, we report a Dorylus (Anomma) rubellus attack on a colony of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes subhyalinus that was observed during the dry season in a savannah habitat in Nigeria's Gashaka National Park. It was estimated that several hundred thousand termites (probably more than 2.4 kg dry mass) were retrieved. The apparent rarity of driver ant predation on Macrotermes nests may be explained by different habitat requirements, by the fact that these ants mostly forage aboveground, by efficient termite defense behavior and nest architecture that make entry into the nest difficult, and finally by driver ant worker morphology, which differs remarkably from that of subterranean Dorylus species that regularly invade and destroy termite colonies.},

	abstract = {The subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus usually nests in rotten wood trunks, which may also be occupied by the Japanese garden ant Lasius japonicus. Few battles were observed between them under ordinary circumstances because they inhabit separate nesting sites. However, once the termite nesting sites were artificially broken, the ant workers invaded and hunted the termites, although the termite soldiers fought against the ants. This study aims to confirm intra- and inter-specific chemical interactions between the termite and ant. Solid phase microextraction–gas chromatograph (SPME-GC) analyses revealed that R. speratus soldiers secreted caste-specific sesquiterpene hydrocarbon when they were irritated. Both the hexane extract of the soldiers and its hydrocarbon fraction, as well as the crushed soldier bodies, attracted the soldiers but dispersed the workers when presented on the trails. We also confirmed that the soldier chemicals enhanced aggressiveness of L. japonicus, which rushed around the odor sources and hunted any termites that were present. These findings suggest that: (i) the soldier–specific secretion might serve as an alarm pheromone in termite chemical communication, in which components recruit soldiers and also warn the other colony members away; and (ii) termite communication is eavesdropped on by L. japonicus workers to locate and hunt the termites.},

	abstract = {1.Colonies of Pheidole dentata employ a complex strategy of colony defense against invading fire ants. Their responses can be conveniently divided into the following three phases: (1) at low stimulation, the minor workers recruit nestmates over considerable distances, after which the recruited major workers (“soldiers”) take over the main role of destroying the intruders; (2) when the fire ants invade in larger numbers, fewer trails are laid, and the Pheidole fight closer to the nest along a shorter perimeter; (3) when the invasion becomes still more intense, the Pheidole abscond with their brood and scatter outward in all directions (Figs. 1, 4).2.Recruitment is achieved by a trail pheromone emitted from the poison gland of the sting. Majors can distinguish trail-laying minors that have just contacted fire ants, apparently by transfer of the body odor, and they respond by following the trails with more looping, aggressive runs than is the case in recruitment to sugar water. Majors are superior in fighting to the minors and remain on the battleground longer.3.The first phase of defense, involving alarm-recruitment, is evoked most strongly by fire ants and other members of the genus Solenopsis; the presence of a single fire ant worker is often sufficient to produce a massive, prolonged response (Figs. 2, 5, 6). In tests with Solenopsis geminata, it was found that the Pheidole react both to the odor of the body surface and to the venom, provided either of these chemical cues are combined with movement. Fire ants, especially S. geminata, are among the major natural enemies of the Pheidole, and it is of advantage for the Pheidole colonies to strike hard and decisively when the first fire ant scouts are detected. Other ants of a wide array of species tested were mostly neutral or required a large number of workers to induce the response. The alarm-recruitment response is not used when foragers are disturbed by human hands or inanimate objects. When such intrusion results in a direct mechanical disturbance of the nest, simulating the attack of a vertebrate, both minor and major workers swarm out and attack without intervening recruitment.},

The ants of the “hyperdiverse” genus Pheidole produce two discrete sterile castes, soldiers and minor workers. Within Pheidole, there is tremendous interspecific variation in proportion of soldiers. The causes and correlates of caste ratio variation among species of Pheidole remain enigmatic. Here we test whether a body size threshold model accounts for interspecific variation in caste ratio in Pheidole, such that species with larger body sizes produce relatively fewer soldiers within their colonies. We evaluated the caste ratio of 26 species of Pheidole and found that the body size of workers accounts for interspecific variation in the production of soldiers as we predicted. Twelve species sampled from one forest in Costa Rica yielded the same relationship as found in previously published data from many localities. We conclude that production of soldiers in the most species-rich group of ants is regulated by a body size threshold mechanism, and that the great variation in body size and caste ratio in Pheidole plays a role in niche divergence in this rapidly evolving taxon.},

	abstract = {THE success of organisms and their increasing complexity throughout the course of evolution are thought to have depended on a small number of important transitions, one of which was the shift from a solitary lifestyle to societies of organisms exhibiting division of labour and having specialized castes1,2. The most familiar examples of the advantages arising from division of labour and caste differentiation come from social insects3. It has been suggested that the proportion of workers of various physical castes has evolved to enhance the fitness of colony members4,6 with the prediction that caste ratios should vary with environmental factors such as predation, competition and food availability. However, because it has been difficult to manipulate experimentally the environmental factors believed to influence optimal caste ratio, demonstration of adaptive caste distribution has remained elusive7–10. Here we show that colonies of the ant Pheidole pallidula increase the relative investment in soldier production after perceiving the presence of foreign con-specific colonies. This is the first experimental demonstration of a social insect altering physical caste ratios in an adaptive manner.},

	abstract = {After biologist Deborah Gordon made a series of experimental discoveries in the 1980s, she argued that a change in terminology regarding the division of labor among castes of specialists was needed. Gordon’s investigations of the interactive effects of ants in colonies led her to believe that the established approach Edward O. Wilson had pioneered was biased in a way that made some alternative candidate adaptive explanations invisible. Gordon argued that this was because the term “division of labor” implied a division among specialists that was unwarranted, and proposed “task allocation” as a better description that did not bias research against the alternative causes she had discovered. Gordon’s empirical findings and theoretical proposals also vindicate the initial critics of Wilson’s human sociobiology who have been dismissed as political radicals, but her proposals have been widely misunderstood by many contemporary behavioral ecologists. The terminological and methodological confusions rampant in contemporary discourse can be clarified by applying a framework developed by Elisabeth Lloyd involving an analysis of the constraints imposed by different research questions. Applying this framework will show how the methodological problems involving description raised by the initial critics of Wilson’s human sociobiology extended to his analysis of ants, indicating that they were not challenging Wilson’s naturalistic approach to the study of human evolution, but rather his methods. It will also show how confusion over how Gordon’s proposed research questions have been conflated with the possible answers she has argued ought to be investigated. This in turn will clarify contemporary disputes over her proposal to abandon the term “division of labor.”},

	abstract = {Interspecific trade-offs in foraging strategies can facilitate species coexistence in diverse communities with overlapping resource
use, especially in taxa with complex social-foraging strategies. The discovery-dominance trade-off hypothesis is often invoked to
help explain coexistence of ant species that use overlapping food resources, wherein colonies of some species are better at
collectively discovering new food, while others have superior social fighting abilities to subsequently assert dominance over a
resource. This hypothesis has yet to be tested in diverse arboreal ant communities. We assessed the competitive outcomes of
arboreal ants at new food resources and further asked if the number of ants present and their body size influenced the observed
outcomes. We did not find support for a discovery-dominance trade-off. Instead, we identified a discovery-defense strategy,
wherein the first species to collectively forage at a new food resource usually defended it successfully from other species. This
suggests that the discovery phase is the most important for determining the outcome of competition over food in arboreal ants.
This importance was further supported by the insight that the number of ants present largely determined the access of species to
food resources, not individual body size. Broadly, our results suggest that although arboreal ants rely on similar food resources,
coexistence may be mediated in part by the prevalence of the discovery-defense strategy: most species have the capacity to be the
first to discover newly available food resources within the complex canopy, and discovery is coupled with the ability to defend a
new food resource long enough to benefit from it.},

	abstract = {Altogether, 59 ant species from 22 genera of 4 subfamilies have been recorded in Kyiv. Four of them are occasionally introduced species which occur only in premises heated in winter; 19 species are recorded here for the first time for the city. The richness of the myrmecofauna in Kyiv is determined by its position at the boundary of Polesie and Forest-Steppe and by the variety of coenoses within the city. The Kiev myrmecofauna is derived from the zonal faunas of Polesie and Forest-Steppe combined with the azonal southern elements that have penetrated far northwards along the Dnieper valley. The ant species in Kyiv are assigned to 10 zoogeographic complexes; more than half of them have Trans-Palaearctic and Euro-Caucasian distribution. Mesophilic and mesoxerophilic oligotopes predominate in the fauna. The Kyiv ants belong to five chorological complexes: vertical herpetobiont, horizontal herpetobiont, multilevel, soil-litter, and horizontal dendrobiont. The number of ant species in the coniferous and deciduous forests and in the city parks is approximately the same (25–27). The species diversity is lower in meadows, steppe areas, and public gardens (11–16 species), and the lowest (only 4 species) in the streets. The total number of ant species is high not only on the outskirts but also in the central parts of the city due to the presence of forest parks. Four types of multispecies ant assemblages can be distinguished in Kyiv: mono- and bidominant continua of weakly territorial dominants, monodominant assemblages with a territorial dominant, monodominant assemblages with a weakly territorial dominant, and degraded monospecies assemblages without dominants. The state of the population of the invasive species Lasius neglectus, discovered in the center of Kyiv in the summer of 2018, is briefly reviewed and the possibility of its further expansion is considered.},

We report on the use of transient living walls as a mechanism by which avoidance is established between army-ant mass raids and non-prey ant species commonly encountered in the environment (other army ants and leafcutter ants). These transient walls are composed of a series of individuals performing stereotyped posturing displays at the border between interacting colonies. Unlike preemptive column guarding by soldiers, these walls are composed of a variety of worker sub-castes and can arise and disappear rapidly in response to the presence of local threats. Quantified videos of in-field artificial introductions revealed that walking ants switch to the task of posturing within a wall following multiple contacts with non-nestmates and that posturing ants return to walking as contacts with intruders decline and contacts with nestmates increase. The rapid shift of army ants to the task of forming transient walls at the instant when they are needed for traffic management provides a highly observable system in which to study the rules of individual-based living constructions, providing potential insight into similar processes across levels of biological organization.},

	abstract = {Very large colonies of territorially dominant arboreal ants (TDAAs), whose territories are distributed in a mosaic pattern in the canopies of many tropical rainforests and tree crop plantations, have a generally positive impact on their host trees. We studied the canopy of an old Gabonese rainforest (ca 4.25 ha sampled, corresponding to 206 "large" trees) at a stage just preceding forest maturity (the Caesalpinioideae dominated; the Burseraceae were abundant). The tree crowns sheltered colonies from 13 TDAAs plus a co-dominant species out of the 25 ant species recorded. By mapping the TDAAs' territories and using a null model co-occurrence analysis, we confirmed the existence of an ant mosaic. Thanks to a large sampling set and the use of the self-organizing map algorithm (SOM), we show that the distribution of the trees influences the structure of the ant mosaic, suggesting that each tree taxon attracts certain TDAA species rather than others. The SOM also improved our knowledge of the TDAAs' ecological niches, showing that these ant species are ecologically distinct from each other based on their relationships with their supporting trees. Therefore, TDAAs should not systematically be placed in the same functional group even when they belong to the same genus. We conclude by reiterating that, in addition to the role played by TDAAs' territorial competition, host trees contribute to structuring ant mosaics through multiple factors, including host-plant selection by TDAAs, the age of the trees, the presence of extrafloral nectaries, and the taxa of the associated hemipterans.},

	abstract = {The integrity of ant colonies depends exclusively on social relationships between their individuals, especially the ability of communication between group members, which is mainly mediated through chemical signals. Another important feature of ant behavior is territory defense, since they need to gather large amounts of food to feed their larvae, males and breeding females. Thereby, ants might display behavioral strategies to defend their territories from intruders. Here we investigated whether Ectatomma brunneum displays the Dear Enemy Phenomenon, what is the relationship between Cuticular Hydrocarbon composition and levels of aggression during their intraspecific interactions and which compounds and/or classes of compounds might be the most important to modulate the level of aggression. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the levels of aggression through behavioral observations during interactions between 23 pairs of colonies nested in two distinct sites at varied distances. Then, we analyzed the cuticular chemical profile of the individuals involved in the interactions, and compared these results with the levels of aggression displayed between colonies tested. The results allow us to confirm our hypothesis that the DEP occurs in E. brunneum. The higher tolerance between closer colonies can be explained due to their kinship level in addition to sharing the same microhabitats. The results also showed there are significant differences in CHCs profiles, especially between colonies nested at relatively greater distances, and it is likely that differences in content of some branched alkanes are the most important to establish these differences and, therefore, the levels of aggression during the interactions.},

	abstract = {The evolution of ant agriculture, as practised by the fungus-farming ‘attine’ ants, is thought to have arisen in the wet rainforests of South America about 55–65 Ma. Most subsequent attine agricultural evolution, including the domestication event that produced the ancestor of higher attine cultivars, is likewise hypothesized to have occurred in South American rainforests. The ‘out-of-the-rainforest’ hypothesis, while generally accepted, has never been tested in a phylogenetic context. It also presents a problem for explaining how fungal domestication might have occurred, given that isolation from free-living populations is required. Here, we use phylogenomic data from ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci to reconstruct the evolutionary history of fungus-farming ants, reduce topological uncertainty, and identify the closest non-fungus-growing ant relative. Using the phylogeny we infer the history of attine agricultural systems, habitat preference and biogeography. Our results show that the out-of-the-rainforest hypothesis is correct with regard to the origin of attine ant agriculture; however, contrary to expectation, we find that the transition from lower to higher agriculture is very likely to have occurred in a seasonally dry habitat, inhospitable to the growth of free-living populations of attine fungal cultivars. We suggest that dry habitats favoured the isolation of attine cultivars over the evolutionary time spans necessary for domestication to occur.},

Most extant ants belong to the formicoid clade, which contains ∼90\% of described species and has produced the most socially advanced and dominant forms. The remaining ants are old lineages of predominantly cryptobiotic species whose relationships to one another and to the formicoids remain unclear. Rooting the ant tree is challenging because of (a) a long branch separating ants from their nearest outgroup, and (b) heterogeneity in evolutionary rates and base composition among ant lineages.

We investigated the spatial patterns of inter-colony aggression within and between two Pheidole species of seed-harvesting ants in the Mojave Desert of California by quantifying aggression between colonies in standardized staged encounters. We also tested whether the level of fighting between workers of two colonies is affected by previous exposure to each other. We show that neighbors (i.e., colonies less that 2.6 m away) of either species are treated less aggressively than more distant colonies and that habituation may be a mechanism by which this discrimination is achieved. The variation in aggression among spatially distant colonies also suggests that additional genetic or environmental factors are involved in recognition. The function of the dear-enemy phenomenon in these ant species may be related to the greater risk to the resources of a colony presented by strange workers than workers from a neighboring colony.},

One of five Pheidole populations studied had higher caste ratios (soldiers /workers) in reproductive colonies as predicted, and in no species did caste functions conform to predictions. We also adapted three models from plant defense theory to study between-species patterns of caste allocation. Among 12 litter Pheidole the amount of sterile biomass devoted to soldiers varied from 18 to 62\%. Queen size, growth rate, and soldier investment positively covaried. Only one model, the cost of replacement hypothesis (McKey 1979), correctly predicted that species with costly female alates invest more in defense. The two hypotheses linking apparency to defense may also be valid if fast-growing colonies are more likely to attract the attention of predators.},

	abstract = {The attine ant–fungus agricultural symbiosis evolved over tens of millions of years, producing complex societies with industrial-scale farming analogous to that of humans. Here we document reciprocal shifts in the genomes and transcriptomes of seven fungus-farming ant species and their fungal cultivars. We show that ant subsistence farming probably originated in the early Tertiary (55–60 MYA), followed by further transitions to the farming of fully domesticated cultivars and leaf-cutting, both arising earlier than previously estimated. Evolutionary modifications in the ants include unprecedented rates of genome-wide structural rearrangement, early loss of arginine biosynthesis and positive selection on chitinase pathways. Modifications of fungal cultivars include loss of a key ligninase domain, changes in chitin synthesis and a reduction in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes as the ants gradually transitioned to functional herbivory. In contrast to human farming, increasing dependence on a single cultivar lineage appears to have been essential to the origin of industrial-scale ant agriculture.},

This applies to localized island radiations such as Darwin's finches, and also to rapid radiations occurring on a global scale. Here we analyse the macroevolution and macroecology of Pheidole, a famously hyperdiverse and ecologically dominant ant genus. We generate and analyse four novel datasets: (i) a robust global phylogeny including 285 Pheidole species, (ii) a global database on regional Pheidole richness in 365 political areas summarizing over 97 000 individual records from more than 6500 studies, (iii) a global database of Pheidole richness from 3796 local communities and (iv) a database of Pheidole body sizes across species. Analysis of the potential climate drivers of richness revealed that the patterns are statistically very similar across different biogeographic regions, with both regional and local richness associated with the same coefficients of temperature and precipitation. This similarity occurs even though phylogenetic analysis shows that Pheidole reached dominance in communities through serial localized radiations into different biomes within different continents and islands. Pheidole body size distributions have likewise converged across geographical regions. We propose these cases of convergence indicate that the global radiation of Pheidole is structured by deterministic factors regulating diversification and diversity.},

	abstract = {Ant colonies self-organize to solve complex problems despite the simplicity of an individual ant’s brain. Pavement ant Tetramorium caespitum colonies must solve the problem of defending the territory that they patrol in search of energetically rich forage. When members of 2 colonies randomly interact at the territory boundary a decision to fight occurs when: 1) there is a mismatch in nestmate recognition cues and 2) each ant has a recent history of high interaction rates with nestmate ants. Instead of fighting, some ants will decide to recruit more workers from the nest to the fighting location, and in this way a positive feedback mediates the development of colony wide wars. In ants, the monoamines serotonin (5-HT) and octopamine (OA) modulate many behaviors associated with colony organization and in particular behaviors associated with nestmate recognition and aggression. In this article, we develop and explore an agent-based model that conceptualizes how individual changes in brain concentrations of 5-HT and OA, paired with a simple threshold-based decision rule, can lead to the development of colony wide warfare. Model simulations do lead to the development of warfare with 91\% of ants fighting at the end of 1 h. When conducting a sensitivity analysis, we determined that uncertainty in monoamine concentration signal decay influences the behavior of the model more than uncertainty in the decision-making rule or density. We conclude that pavement ant behavior is consistent with the detection of interaction rate through a single timed interval rather than integration of multiple interactions.},

Protein-rich food in early spring is mainly for the benefit of the queens and the sexual larvae.

	abstract = {1. There has been considerable debate on the importance of competition in ecological communities, but its importance in structuring ant assemblages has often been uncritically accepted. Here, we briefly review field experiments examining competition in ant assemblages and use a removal experiment to test the effect of the classical territorial dominant ant, Formica aquilonia. Ants of this species group are thought to structure communities through a dominance hierarchy. 2. First, we used pitfall traps to compare the abundance of other ants in replicated sites with low and high densities of F. aquilonia. We found differences in community composition, in particular, Camponotus herculeanus was more common in low-density sites, in accordance with predictions. Differences in ant assemblages were not owing to differences in measured habitat variables. 3. We removed F. aquilonia from a set of high-density sites, using physical and chemical methods, and repeated these procedures at procedural control sites. One year after removal, abundances of F. aquilonia at removal sites were similar to those at low-density sites. However, the composition of other species did not change in response to F. aquilonia removal. Replication rates were identical in the mensurative and experimental components of this study, so this is unlikely to be owing to the analysis being insufficiently powerful. 4. We suggest three possibilities for the lack of difference. First, the study may have been too short term or small scale to detect differences. However, previous studies have shown effects on smaller spatial- and temporal-scales. Second, priority effects may be important in the successful colonisation by F. aquilonia. Thirdly, boreal ant assemblages may be too depauperate for redundancy in ecological roles and for competition to play an important structuring role. 5. We thus recommend that long-term large-scale experiments be considered essential if we are to distinguish between competing hypotheses in community ecology.},

	abstract = {Hymenoptera pollinators and figs (ripe or unripe) of Ficus vallis-choudae are protected from the predatory activity of myrmicine ants (Atopomyrmex mocquerisi; Crematogaster clariventris; Crematogaster sp.) by other ants (Camponotus acvapimensis and Camponotus brutus; Formicinae) who attack neither unripe figs nor the pollinator. On trees occupied by Atopomyrmex and Crematogaster, and on trees invaded by columns of workers after recruitment by scouts, the predatory activity begins when the fig wasps emerge. Then, the ants attack unripe figs (asynchronization in ripeness), destroying whole figs of certain trees. The male function of the trees through pollen dispersal by fig wasps is, therefore, severely reduced, while the female function (seed dispersal) is affected only on unripe figs before fig wasp emergence. We recorded 13 ant species on the 73 Ficus vallis-choudae of the Batchenga savanna (Cameroon) studied, but only the five previously cited species were able to occupy an entire fig tree. The three Myrmicinae which have a status of dominant (large colony size; strong territoriality vis-à-vis other dominant species; can tolerate non-dominant species) tended scale insects. Both Camponotus species (and the eight other ant species) are non-dominant (small colony size), but are able to occupy a whole tree under certain conditions (here, when they tend the tettigometrid Hilda undata) and to be territorial. Their status corresponds, therefore, to that of sub-dominant. Tests of aggressiveness showed that each ant species is aggressive towards alien conspecifics. C. brutus individuals were tolerated on fig trees occupied by Atopomyrmex mocquerisi or by Crematogaster clariventris, while workers of both latter species, who do not tolerate one another, were not tolerated on fig trees occupied by C. brutus. In this situation, the cost-benefit for the trees depends on the ant species that occupies their foliage; C. brutus, when tending tettigometrids, is advantageous. There is, therefore, an indirect influence of the tettigometrids on the production of fig pollinating wasps and seeds.},

	abstract = {After first being ground-nesters and predators or scavengers, ants became arboreal with the rise of angiosperms and provided plants a biotic defense by foraging for prey on their foliage. Plants induce ants to patrol on their leaves through food rewards (e.g., extra-floral nectar and food bodies), while ants attend hemipterans for their honeydew. Most arboreal-nesting ants build their own nests, but myrmecophytes, plants that offer hollow structures that serve as nesting places to specialized "plant-ants", illustrate the tight evolutionary bonds between ants and plants. In tree-crop plantations and in some rainforest canopies territorially-dominant arboreal ants have large colonies with large and/or polydomous nests. Their territories are defended both intra-and interspecifically, and are distributed in a mosaic pattern, creating what has become known as "arboreal ant mosaics". They tolerate non-dominant species with smaller colonies on their territories. Arboreal ant mosaics are dynamic because ant nesting preferences differ depending on the species and the size and age of supporting trees. Because the canopy is discontinuous, arboreal-foraging ants can be found in ant mosaics; invasive ants can affect also the structure of the mosaic. We discuss here the methods that permit us to study these mosaics. Territorially-dominant arboreal ants are good predators that use group ambushing to catch flying insects on their host tree foliage. When producing winged sexuals they also forage for prey on the ground and plunder the colonies of non-dominant species sharing their host tree. When expanding their territories, the workers of the victorious colony raid the defeated colony. Because territorially-dominant arboreal ants prey on herbivores and strongly affect their general activity, ants are frequently used as biological control agents.},

When these army ants forage from a central nest site they separate neigh-bouring raids by using a pattern similar to that used by many plants in spiral phyllotaxis. During the intervening periods of migration, raids and emigrations are orientated to lower the probability that the raid path will cross itself and also to separate the successive bouts of central place foraging. This orientation has been analysed by a series of alternative, analytical models which reveal that the navigation is achieved by each day's raid and emigration being constrained to take roughly the same compass bearing as these activities on the previous day.},

As singular and strange as some of the weapons we encounter on these pages are, we learn that similar factors set their evolution in motion. Emlen uses these patterns to draw parallels to the way we humans develop and employ our own weapons, and have since battle began. He looks at everything from our armor and camouflage to the evolution of the rifle and the structures human populations have built across different regions and eras to protect their homes and communities. With stunning black and white drawings and gorgeous color illustrations of these concepts at work, Animal Weapons brings us the complete story of how weapons reach their most outsized, dramatic potential, and what the results we witness in the animal world can tell us about our own relationship with weapons of all kinds.},

It's a developing field that rarely features in conferences on aging biology, where the focus is on mice, Drosophila fruit flies, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Yet some scientists are convinced that social insects promise new ways to understand aging. Many live far longer than the more popular model organisms, and aging in social insects is plastic, changing with social context. Revealing the molecular mechanisms behind these strange phenomena may ultimately shed more light on aging in general, scientists say.

Co-occurring species overlap on prey resources, and regular colony movements and long-distance raiding increase interspecific interference. We hypothesised interspecific competition selects for temporal separation of species' raid periods into diurnal versus nocturnal activity. We predicted species would differ significantly in their timing of foraging. We further predicted timing would differ among congeners because close relatives likely overlap in resource needs. Trail walk encounter rates were used to estimate species' diurnal versus nocturnal foraging activity at four Neotropical sites. Army ant species differed significantly in foraging times. There were significantly diurnal and nocturnal specialists; some species foraged at similar rates day and night. Two genera (Eciton and Neivamyrmex) included both diurnal and nocturnal specialists. Relative eye size (a morphological indicator of above-ground activity) was positively associated with diel foraging specialisation (both diurnal and nocturnal). Temporal separation of foraging times may play a role in allowing Neotropical army ant species to occupy the same habitat. Diel specialisation may be a common mechanism for species coexistence in tropical forests where season-based phenological changes are often moderated.},

	abstract = {Lanchester's “Laws of Combat” are mathematical principles that have long been used to model military conflict. More recently, they have been applied to conflict among animals, including ants, birds, lions, and chimpanzees. Lanchester's Linear Law states that, where combat between two groups is a series of one-on-one duels, fighting strength is proportional to group size, as one would expect. However, Lanchester's Square Law states that, where combat is all-against-all, fighting strength is proportional to the square of group size. If conflict has been important in our evolutionary history, we might expect humans to have evolved assessment mechanisms that take Lanchester's Laws of Combat into account. Those that did would have reaped great dividends; those that did not might have made a quick exit from the gene pool. We hypothesize that: (1) the dominant and most lethal form of combat in human evolutionary history (as well as among chimpanzees and some social carnivores) has been asymmetric raids in which multiple individuals gang up on a few opponents, approximating Square Law combat; and (2) this would have favored the natural selection of an evolved “Square Law heuristic” that correlated fighting strength not with raw group size but with group size squared. We discuss the implications for primate evolution, human evolution, coalitionary psychology, and contemporary war.},

The nonoverlapping, three-dimensional territories in the canopy had a ground size up to 0.8 ha. C. gigas showed a distinct territorial behavior: (1) speciﬁc “barrack” nests, especially containing many majors, were situated at the borders and were established during long-term territorial conﬂicts; (2) trunk trails were regularly patrolled by majors that attacked alien conspeciﬁcs and some other ant species violently; and (3) sentinels, often involved in long-enduring conﬂicts with neighboring ant colonies, defended the borders at bridgeheads. Interspeciﬁc conﬂicts with sympatric Camponotus species always led to violent, “bloody” ﬁghts of all castes. Intraspeciﬁc conﬂicts, however, were solved by ritual ﬁghts (“front leg boxing”) of majors. C. gigas performed a deescalation strategy to end short periods of true intraspeciﬁc “ant war” that we provoked experimentally. Artiﬁcially induced ritualized combats continued over weeks also in the absence of baits, indicating that borders may become established by long-term conﬂicts of attrition. We discuss the differences between ritual ﬁghts in desert and rainforest ants and apply Lanchester’s theory of battles to our ﬁndings.},

Mechanisms of queen control were investigated. A queen-larvae segregation experiment demonstrated that direct contact between queens and larvae was required for larval inhibition, and worker produced trophic egg consumption by larvae was significantly reduced in the presence of queens. This is the first documentation of this form of nutritional deprivation as an inhibitory mechanism. A second mechanism may include the smearing of queen produced eggs on the larvae.

Ants were sorted by genera into fighting and nonfighting groups, based on observations of interspecific interactions with other ant species. In all of the genera with monomorphic worker castes that fight during competition, the non‐native species were smaller than the native species. The genera that engage in combat had a higher frequency of significantly smaller size in non‐native ants. I selected Wasmannia auropunctata for further studies, to compare native and non‐native populations. Specimens of W. auropunctata from non‐native populations were smaller than conspecific counterparts from its native habitat. I consider hypotheses to explain why non‐native ants are smaller in size than native ants, including the role of colony size in interspecific fights, changes in life history, the release from intraspecific fighting, and climate. The discovery that fighting non‐natives are smaller than their closest native relatives may provide insight into the mechanisms for success of non‐native species, as well as the role of worker size and colony size during interspecific competition.},

	abstract = {Spatial mosaics in resource productivity may facilitate competitive coexistence when species differ in their ability to exploit resource-rich vs. resource-poor conditions. In this study, I investigated the influence of a termite-generated spatial mosaic in resource productivity on the dynamics of competition and coexistence in a guild of four acacia ants that reside on Acacia drepanolobium. Near termite mounds, both new shoot production of A. drepanolobium and densities of litter-dwelling invertebrates (an important food source of the acacia ants) are higher than in “matrix” habitats between mounds. This resource variation is spatially correlated with the outcome of competition among acacia ants for host trees; near the mounds, competitively dominant species are more likely to supplant subordinates, whereas the likelihood of subordinates replacing dominants on host trees increases with distance from mounds. Variation in competitive outcomes among patch types appears to result from differential responses among acacia ant species to resource heterogeneity. Analysis of average tissue δ15N levels indicated that acacia ant colonies near termite mounds had higher ratios of animal prey in their diets than colonies in matrix areas. Bait trials and analysis of average nest size in mound and matrix habitats suggest that competitively dominant species are disproportionately successful in exploiting higher prey densities near termite mounds. Increased dietary uptake of nitrogen-rich prey may fuel more rapid colony growth in competitively dominant acacia ants, resulting in more pronounced asymmetries in colony size between dominant and subordinate species in mound areas. Because colony size asymmetry is a key determinant of interspecific competitive outcomes, colonies of subordinate species near termite mounds may be more vulnerable to aggressive take-overs by dominants. In lower-productivity matrix habitats, increased tolerance to low-resource conditions may afford subordinate species greater persistence. Overall, these results suggest that termite-induced habitat heterogeneity plays a significant role in the dynamics of the acacia ant community, and may contribute to species coexistence in this intensely competitive community.},

	abstract = {log ial 00The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is a widespread invasive species characterized by reduced intraspecific aggression within introduced populations. To illuminate the mechanisms underlying nestmate recognition in Argentine ants, we studied the spatial and temporal fidelity of intraspecific aggression in an introduced population of Argentine ants within which intraspecific aggression does occur. We quantified variation in the presence or absence of intraspecific aggression among nests over time both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions to gain insight into the role of environmental factors as determinants of nestmate discriminatory ability. In addition, we compared levels of intraspecific aggression between nest pairs to the similarity of their cuticular hydrocarbons to determine the potential role of these compounds as labels for nestmate discrimination. In both field and laboratory comparisons, nest pairs behaved in a consistent manner throughout the course of the experiment: pairs that fought did so for an entire year, and pairs that did not fight remained nonaggressive. Moreover, we found a negative relationship between cuticular hydrocarbon similarity and the degree of aggression between nests, suggesting that these hydrocarbons play a role in nestmate},

This relationship serves as an important link between the performance of individual colonies and the behaviour of populations experiencing density-dependent competition for space. 2. Territory area, colony mass, and the numbers of ants of each caste and developmental stage, were measured for colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta across a wide range of sizes. 3. Most of the variation in territory area was explained by colony size, measured either by worker number, worker biomass or colony biomass. 4. The nature of this relationship was linear in May, when colonies were near their annual minimum size, but non-linear in November, when they were near their annual maximum. Territories of a given size were occupied by larger colonies in November than May, probably because in this saturated population the simultaneous increase in worker number in all colonies occurred without room for territorial expansion. 5. Mound volume, which can be quickly measured without disturbing the colony, provided a reasonable estimate of colony or worker biomass and explained most of the variance in territory size.},

This overdispersion might be driven by competition for food resources or nest sites and may result from established colonies preventing incipient colonies from settling too close to them. We investigated another possible mechanism for overdispersion: active nest choice by emigrating colonies. Colonies may be influenced by the presence of conspecifics when they are emigrating from a nest that has become uninhabitable. In the laboratory, we presented Temnothorax albipennis ant colonies with a choice of three new nests, which were equidistant from their old nest site. The new nests were identical except that one was near to an established conspecific colony. The emigrating colonies significantly preferred the new nest site that was furthest from the resident colony. This selection was not just the result of access to the other nests being blocked by aggression from the resident colony; emigrating colonies thus made active choices. Odour cues may influence nest selection: odours left around nest sites by foreign colonies deterred nest occupancy. There was more aggression near the resident colony, but this appeared to be caused by the greater density of resident ants there rather than those ants being more aggressive per capita. We also observed a relatively high proportion of fusions between colonies. Possible reasons for this are considered together with their implications.},

	abstract = {Animal societies depend on effective defence of group resources. Defensive mechanisms can be costly and may constrain the evolution of social structure. We analysed how exocrine mechanisms of colony defence were affected by the evolution of social complexity and of nest architecture in paper wasps (Vespidae). Eusocial paper wasp species exhibit two discrete grades of eusociality, with new colonies founded either by queens or by coordinated swarms of queens and workers. Swarm-founding shows multiple evolutionary origins from independent-founding ancestors within the Vespidae. Nest architecture also varies among paper wasps. Nests with covering envelopes evolved from naked combs several times. We hypothesized that: (1) evolutionary transitions from independent- to swarm-founding would obviate the need for chemical defence against ants and (2) transitions from naked combs to enveloped nests would have a similar effect on chemical defence. In support of the first hypothesis, we found that all independent-founding species possess ant-repellent glands (Van der Vecht's gland), while many swarm-founders do not. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggested that evolutionary loss of this gland was statistically more likely to follow transitions to swarm-founding. Evolution of nest envelopes was less strongly associated with losses of the ant repellent gland. These patterns suggest that maintenance of defensive exocrine glands is costly. The patterns also suggest that group behavioural defence against ants is a key adaptive feature associated with the evolution of swarm-founding. The hypothesis that the evolution of nest envelopes obviated chemical defence against ants was not as well supported.},

Reductions in the diversity and abundance of native ants resulting from ant invasions give rise to a variety of direct and indirect effects on non-ant taxa.

Recent work in humans demonstrated that the experience of pain occurs due to the activation of a “pain network” that integrates nociceptive sensory information, memory, emotion, cognition, and self-awareness. In humans, the processing of nociceptive sensory information alone does not produce the subjective experience of pain. Insect nociception is processed largely in parallel in two higherorder areas in the brain: the mushroom bodies and the central complex. There is little evidence of a coordinated pain network that would integrate these two areas with each other along with other traits thought to be important for a pain experience in humans. However, it is difﬁcult to exclude the possibility that insects could have a modest pain experience using a less integrated neural circuit. This possibility seems unlikely, however, because even a modest experience would require some neuronal investment. It is unclear whether insects would beneﬁt from such an investment. Recent work in artiﬁcial intelligence suggests that relatively simple, cost-efﬁcient circuits can produce adaptive behaviours without subjective experience. Given our current understanding of insect behaviour, neurobiology, and evolution, the likelihood that insects experience pain is low.},

	abstract = {1. Niche traits (those that describe a species' niche) are not constant within a species, and the importance of intraspecific variation is increasingly appreciated. However, little is known about the extent of niche variability across species. This study investigated variation in dietary and temporal niches of ant species in two tropical rainforests. 2. Ants were collected from baits reflecting seven different natural resources and from pitfalls at 128 grid points. Sampling was done separately for day and night. Co‐occurrence analyses were used to estimate the monopolisation capacity of each species. 3. It was expected that species would show similar dietary and temporal preferences across sites. Therefore, species with high or low niche variability between grid points (within a site) should show similar tendencies when comparing sites. It was predicted that between sites, intraspecific variability should be lower than interspecific variability, and that numerically dominant species should have higher monopolisation rates and lower intraspecific niche variability than less common ones. 4. These results showed that niche traits such as temporal activity and realised food niche shifted drastically between conspecifics of different sites. Even the most common species showed different food or temporal preferences between sites. In general, species with the highest monopolisation rates displayed lower niche variability. 5. This study also demonstrates that niche characterisation via combined continuous rather than categorical values permits a quantification of a species' niche variability. Categorising niche traits without considering context dependency may be misleading if one tries to assess niche width and a species' ability to cope with environmental change. Niche traits can shift drastically between conspecifics of different sites. Species with the highest monopolisation rates displayed lower niche variability. Categorising niche traits without considering context dependency may be misleading.},

2. We tested predictions concerning how competitive interactions are modified by anthropogenic habitat disturbance in ground‐foraging ant assemblages inhabiting fragmented Inter‐Andean tropical dry forests in southwestern Colombia, and investigated ant assemblages recruiting to baits in 10 forest fragments exposed to varying level of human disturbance.
3. Specifically, we evaluated how different components of competitive interactions (patterns of species co‐occurrence, resource partitioning, numerical dominance, and interspecific trade‐offs between discovery and dominance competition) varied with level of habitat disturbance in a human‐dominated ecosystem.
4. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the role of competitive interactions in structuring ground‐foraging ant communities at baits varied with respect to habitat disturbance. As disturbance increased, community structure was more likely to exhibit random co‐occurrence patterns, higher levels of monopolization of food resources by dominant ants, and disproportionate dominance of a single species, the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata ). At a regional scale, we found evidence for a trade‐off between dominance and discovery abilities of the 15 most common species at baits.
5. Together, these results suggest that human disturbance modifies the outcome of competitive interactions in ground‐foraging ant assemblages and may promote dominant species that reduce diversity and coexistence in tropical ecosystems.},

Although F. fuscocinerea is native to Southern Germany, these mass occurrences resemble ant invasions in density and dominance. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms that promote sudden mass occurrence of a previously inconspicuous ant species within its native range. To estimate the competitive dominance of F. fuscocinerea, species occurrence and abundance considering biotic and abiotic parameters were studied in a natural habitat where F. fuscocinerea co-occurred with two other common ant species, Myrmica ruginodis (Nylander) and Lasius niger (Linnaeus). To understand the species’ distribution in the field, laboratory experiments on interspecific competition were conducted. Finally, the colony structure of F. fuscocinerea was investigated with intraspecific aggression tests. Formica fuscocinerea dominated an area that, as indicated by strongly frequented foraging trails on the trees, provided important food sources, e.g. trophobionts, to the ants. Other ant species coexisted only at the periphery of the F. fuscocinerea range. Laboratory experiments revealed F. fuscocinerea as highly dominant species. Additionally, F. fuscocinerea showed a complete lack of intraspecific aggression between ants originating from distances up to 58 km, indicating weak or nonexistent behavioral boundaries among ants of physically separated nests. Since extraordinarily high worker densities, strong interspecific dominance and a lack of colony boundaries within supercolonies are considered to be important traits of several invasive ant species we conclude that the same traits also promote the dominance of F. fuscocinerea.},

In separate trials each with a different food resource, the native S. geminata×xyloni retrieved the greatest amount of a protein- and lipid-rich artificial food resource and a high protein natural food resource, and the native S. geminata retrieved the greatest amount of a high carbohydrate food resource. In trials investigating aspects of interference competition at the colony level, the invasive S. invicta proved to be initially more aggressive than S. geminata, but less aggressive than S. geminata×xyloni. Solenopsis invicta eventually controlled more of the foraging arenas against both native forms when colonies were equivalent by worker biomass, but not when colonies were equivalent by worker number. When paired with S. invicta, S. geminata suffered a significantly greater proportional reduction in both workers and entire colonies when colonies were initially standardized by worker biomass, but not when colonies were standardized by worker number. When paired with S. invicta, a significantly greater proportional reduction of workers occurred in S. geminata×xyloni, regardless of how colonies were standardized. In pairwise trials at the individual level, majors always exhibited significantly less mortality than minors, regardless of the Solenopsis form. The majors of both native forms suffered significantly less mortality than those of S. invicta. Superiority in colony-level interference ability appears to be an important mechanism allowing S. invicta to displace native Solenopsis forms. The ability of S. invicta to reach high population densities, because of intrinsic biological characteristics or an escape from natural enemies, plays an important contributory role. Similar mechanisms may underlie the success of other invasive ant species.},

The mining path at Hawks Nest (32°30′S, 152°30′E) passes through closed heath and scrub with some open forest patches. Ant species richness, ant species diversity and the number of individuals seemed to be more dependent on the structure of the ant community present than on site variables. The equitability component however showed a linear increase with time, from which it could be predicted that mined plots would not reach the values on control plots in less than 17 years (95\% C.I. 13–21 yrs).An abrupt replacement of species comprising the ant community occurred approximately nine years after rehabilitation. This can be related to replacement of the dominant species and has been interpreted as interspecific competition determining the structure and hence the diversity of the ant community.Predictive multiple regression equations for species diversity, species richness and the number of individual ants, on mined plots, account for 73\%, 79\% and 93\% of each variance respectively. Independent variables used in the equations were: a floristic component (the absence of a group of plant species found in mature heath); foliage height diversity; the amount of vegetation in vegetation layers (20 to 50 cm and 50 to 100 cm); and soil hardness.},

	abstract = {Living organisms have been moving rapidly toward their favorable thermal regions as climate warms. Their competitive interactions will change significantly as a result of changes in distribution, abundance, and species composition. This study examines the relationship of competition intensity (frequency of competitive interactions) with temperature and the influence of competition on the occurrence of ant species. Competition between ants was surveyed at six different temperature sites using baits and the abundance of ants was surveyed using pitfall traps. The intensity of interspecific competition (abundance-corrected bait species displacement) was high at intermediate temperature sites (unimodal). Ant species are hierarchically organized in behavioral dominance. Two low-temperature ant species had decreased in the rank of behavioral dominance at warmer temperature sites because of the abundance of dominant intermediate temperature ant species. Ant species co-occurred randomly at the local scale. However, they were segregated at regional scale because of environmental filtering (temperature). Ant competition did not influence the occurrence of ant species at local or regional scale. These results suggest that the influence of changes in interspecific competition because of climate warming might not be great for ants in temperate regions.},

	abstract = {1. An animal's energetic condition is causally related to its ability to display costly behaviours such as aggressive behaviours. Aggressive behaviours are used by animals interacting with heterospecifics when competing through interference. Therefore, how does the abundance of energetic resources influence the pattern of interspecific competition by interference at the community level? To answer this, ants were used as models because the aggressiveness of workers is fuelled by the consumption of carbohydrates. 2. It was hypothesised that ant species are more aggressive when carbohydrates were more abundant. Consequently, the strength of competition by interference would increase, changing the patterns of ant species' resource use at the community level. 3. This study experimentally increased the availability of carbohydrates and counted the number of aggressive behaviours, the probability of ant species exclusion, and the composition of ant morphospecies exploring protein baits before and after the addition of carbohydrates. 4. After the addition of carbohydrates, ants displayed 42\% less aggressive behaviour and were twice as prone to exclude other ant species from the protein baits. This led to changes in the composition of ants exploring the protein baits before and after carbohydrate addition. 5. In general, ants became less motivated to engage in competitive interactions when carbohydrates were more available. However, this response was not homogeneous as the occurrence and aggressiveness of some species, such as the nectarivores, were higher when carbohydrates abound. As carbohydrates are mainly offered by plants, this study's results suggest that plants can indirectly shape the structure of ant communities through ant responses to the availability of carbohydrates.},

	abstract = {Species can coexist through equalizing (similar fitness abilities) and stabilizing (unique niche requirements) mechanisms—assuming that intraspecific competition imposes more limitation than interspecific competition. Non-native species often de-stabilize coexistence, suggesting that they bring either a fitness advantage or a distinct niche requirement. We tested whether greater fitness or unique niche requirements best explained a successful North American invasion by the European Myrmica rubra ant. North American invaded-range M. rubra aggressively sting and occur in enormous numbers (suggesting a fitness advantage), yet our study site has a history of anthropogenic disturbance that might favor M. rubra (suggesting a unique niche). We compared M. rubra to native ants, principally the dominant North American woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea, using physiological health (lipids and size), monthly bait station surveys and aggression assays to assess fitness abilities, and we used nest surveys and isotope analysis to assess niche characteristics. We confirmed the field observations with laboratory experiments that tested colony aggression (direct competition) and food retrieval (indirect competition). In both the observational and experimental investigations, we found little evidence of M. rubra interspecific competitive advantage (aggression or food retrieval) or niche differentiation. Instead, M. rubra violated the basic assumption of coexistence theory: intraspecific competition consistently was less than interspecific competition. Freed up from the costs and limitations of territorial competition, some non-native species may outcompete native species by not competing with themselves. This ‘friendly release’ from intraspecific competition provides an ecological mechanism for some successful invasions.},

	abstract = {A key focus of ecologists is explaining the origin and maintenance of morphological diversity and its association with ecological success. We investigate potential benefits and costs of a common and varied morphological trait, cuticular spines, for foraging behavior, interspecific competition, and predator–prey interactions in naturally co-occurring spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis) in an experimental setting. We expect that a defensive trait like spines might be associated with more conspicuous foraging, a greater number of workers sent out to forage, and potentially increased competitive ability. Alternatively, consistent with the ecological trade-off hypothesis, we expect that investment in spines for antipredator defense might be negatively correlated with these other ecological traits. We find little evidence for any costs to ecological traits, instead finding that species with longer spines either outperform or do not differ from species with shorter spines for all tested metrics, including resource discovery rate and foraging effort as well as competitive ability and antipredator defense. Spines appear to confer broad antipredator benefits and serve as a form of defense with undetectable costs to key ecological abilities like resource foraging and competitive ability, providing an explanation for both the ecological success of the study genus and the large number of evolutionary origins of this trait across all ants. This study also provides a rare quantitative empirical test of ecological effects related to a morphological trait in ants.},

While the emission and detection of alarm pheromones is the universally accepted mechanism of panic communication, there are still open questions about the specific pheromones and type of ant-to-ant contacts involved in specific scenarios, and how relevant is the role of non-chemical communication. Here we report experiments suggesting that panicked ants can transmit danger information through a physical barrier to nestmates located in a safe arena when danger is simulated by using insect repellent. As ants in the safe arena get danger information from nestmates trapped in an area contaminated with a chemical, they retreat from the barrier in average. Visual clues and pure mutual antennation seem to play a minor role as mechanisms of danger information transmission through the obstacle. A detailed quantification of the ant behavior reveals that examination of the legs of ants in the danger arena by nestmates in the safe one may be relevant for danger information transmission.},

Many task allocation studies focus on social insect species with discrete morphological worker subcastes, such as those possessing major and minor workers with strongly differentiated body plans. Much less is known about task partitioning among size-variable workers lacking discrete morphological subcastes. We investigated task fidelity and its correlation with worker size in Formica species with differing degrees of body size variation. During a mark-recapture study that focused on three worker tasks (honeydew collection, nest building, and protein foraging) across 2 days, 98.6\% of 3570 recaptured workers exhibited task fidelity. In species with high levels of worker size variation, worker size is strongly correlated with task performance. This size-task correlation is weaker, but still present, in species with less variably sized workers. Our results suggest that Formica use size-based task partitioning, a form of morphological polyethism. We expect social insects with and without discrete morphological worker subcastes to differ in ontogeny, evolutionary history, and degree of behavioral flexibility. Identifying the scope of variation in task partitioning mechanisms will facilitate comparative studies, thereby elucidating evolutionary histories and outcomes of alternative strategies.},

	abstract = {Insect societies face many social parasites that exploit their altruistic behaviours or their resources. Due to the fitness costs these social parasites incur, hosts have evolved various behavioural, chemical, architectural and morphological defence traits. Similar to bacteria infecting multicellular hosts, social parasites have to successfully go through several steps to exploit their hosts. Here, we review how social insects try to interrupt this sequence of events. They can avoid parasite contact by choosing to nest in parasite-free locales or evade attacks by adapting their colony structure. Once social parasites attack, hosts attempt to detect them, which can be facilitated by adjustments in colony odour. If social parasites enter the nest, hosts can either aggressively defend their colony or take their young and flee. Nest structures are often shaped to prevent social parasite invasion or to safeguard host resources. Finally, if social parasites successfully establish themselves in host nests, hosts can rebel by killing the parasite brood or by reproducing in the parasites' presence. Hosts of social parasites can therefore develop multiple traits, leading to the evolution of complex defence portfolios of co-dependent traits. Social parasites can respond to these multi-level defences with counter-adaptations, potentially leading to geographical mosaics of coevolution.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Evolution of pathogen and parasite avoidance behaviours’.},

	abstract = {Attack pheromones in Atta cephalotes are important in coordinating defense responses to protect the colony. Little is known about the dynamics of A. cephalotes defenses and their underlying mechanisms (Whitehouse and Jaffe 1996). The objective of this study was to test for differences in response between four colonies and between the three classes of ant; minor, worker, and soldiers. Eight treatments were performed to carry out the two experiments. Toothpicks were coated with the attack pheromone from each of the four colonies and each of the three castes and one toothpick was tested without any pheromone as a control. Using a Kruskal- Wallis and Post- Hoc test, eight relationships were found to be significant. It was determined that the minor class is the primary attacking class for attack pheromones (Kruskal-Wallis p-value {\textless} .0001, df = 2). These data indicate that A. cephalotes follows the square law proposed by Franks and Partridge (1993). Initially, these minors responded more intensely to the pheromone of their own pheromones (Kruskal-Wallis p-value = .0036, df = 3). Over the full 20-minute duration of the trial they responded more greatly to the worker pheromone (Kruskal-Wallis p-value = 0.0042, df = 3). The response of the worker class during the trials was greater for the minor pheromone (Kruskal-Wallis p-value = 0.0099, df = 3). The overall response by A. Cephalotes was greater for the toothpicks with the attack pheromone than it was for the control (Kruskal-Wallis P-Value = .0260, df= 4). An interesting relationship was uncovered between two of the colonies studied. When the attack pheromone from colony C was placed in the trails of colony D, the response from the colony was not significantly different from that of the control for both the initial and total responses (respectively, Kruskal Wallis p- value = .0030, df = 4 and Kruskal Wallis p- value = .0269, df = 4). These data may have indicated that when colonies are close to one another, as colony C and colony D are, then interactions may cause the dynamic between them to change.},

The costs of defense are complex and involve the risk of injury, the loss of energy ⁄ time, and the erroneous identiﬁcation of a friend as a foe. Our goal was to study the speciﬁcity of defense strategies. We analyzed the aggressive responses of ant colonies by confronting them with workers of an unfamiliar congeneric species, a non-nestmate conspeciﬁc, a co-occurring congeneric competitor species, and a social parasite—a slave-making ant. As expected, the latter species, which can inﬂict dramatic ﬁtness losses to the colony, was treated with most aggression. A co-occurring competitor was also attacked, but the ants used different behaviors in their responses to both enemies. While the slavemaker was attacked by biting and stinging and was approached with spread mandibles, the competitor was dragged, a behavioral strategy only possible if the defending ant is similar in size and strength to the opponent. Non-nestmate conspeciﬁcs were treated aggressively as well, but less than the slavemaker and the co-occurring competitor, presumably because they are less easily recognized as enemies. An unfamiliar congeneric species was rarely attacked. This ﬁrst detailed study comparing the aggressive responses of ant colonies toward slave-making ants to other species posing different threats indicates that the responses of ant colonies are adjusted to the risk each opponent poses to the colony.},

	abstract = {The insect order Hymenoptera is speciose, diverse and common. Many wasps, bees and ants are well known for their ability, and propensity, to engage in agonistic interactions via biting and stinging (chemical injection), and may also interact using chemical deposition and volatile chemical release. Such behaviours are often exhibited during acquisition and defence of resources contested either by conspecifics or by allospecific hymenopterans. Here we examine the types of contests engaged in by social and non-social hymenopterans and highlight links between these and further aspects of evolutionary and applied biology. We first consider factors influencing the outcomes of contests between pairs of females over resources for reproduction. Studies of female–female contests in bethylids and several non-aculeate species of par-asitoid wasps, especially scelionids, pteromalids and eupelmids, have addressed fundamental causes of the outcomes of contest interactions and have further linked contest behaviour to strategies of patch exploitation, clutch size and parental care. Further, we review links between the study of contest behaviour in parasitoids and their use as agents of biological pest control, particularly in terms of how contest behaviour may constitute intra-guild predation and influence strategic decisions to deploy single or multiple species of natural enemies. We then consider contests between males for access to mates, especially those engaged in by fig wasps and other wasps. Male–male contests are placed in the context of the evolution of alternative male morphs, mating systems, sex ratios and social behaviours. Finally, we return to female– female contests, this time examining them in the more complex context of the social Hymenoptera, in which both between-individuals (intra-colony) and between-group (inter-colony) contests occur.},

The genetic conditions that allow such castes to evolve are well understood, but the ecological pressures that select for them are not. We provide compelling evidence that the task of transporting novel prey selected for an exaggerated transport caste, or ‘submajor’, in the army ant Eciton burchellii. This species is the only Eciton that preys upon large arthropods as well as ants, the ancestral prey type, and by comparing load-transport among Eciton species and within E. burchellii, we show that this mixed diet significantly constrains transport efficiency. Crucially, however, we also show that E. burchellii submajors are highly specialized on transporting non-ant prey, and we demonstrate experientially that it is specifically this prey type that constrains prey-transport efficiency. Our study also suggests that phylogenetic constraints associated with the Eciton lifestyle intensified selection for the exaggerated submajor of E. burchellii. Thus, we propose that a novel task may only select for a special caste when phylogenetic constraints preclude the evolution of alternative solutions. This identifies a new and potentially general scenario for the evolution of physical castes.},

We used standardized protocols to estimate foraging raid rates and species composition of army ant communities in four Neotropical forests. The study sites spanned approximately 10° latitude, with two sites each in Central and South America. 2 We recorded a total of 22 species of army ants. The four sites varied in observed and estimated species richness. Species overlap was highest between the Central American sites, and lowest between the South American sites. 3 Raid activity varied significantly among sites. Raid activity per kilometre of trail walks was over four times higher at the most active site (Sta. Maria, Venezuela) than at the least active site (Barro Colorado Island, Panama). Furthermore, each site showed a different diel pattern of activity. For example, raid activity was higher during daylight hours in Costa Rica, and higher at night in Venezuela. Raid activity relationships with ambient temperature also varied significantly among sites. 4 The overall rate of army ant raids passing through 1 m2 plots was 0·73 raids per day, but varied among sites, from 0 raids per day (Panama) to 1·2 raids per day (Venezuela). 5 Primarily subterranean species were significantly more abundant in Venezuela, and above-ground foragers that form large swarm fronts were least abundant in Panama. The site heterogeneity in species abundance and diel activity patterns has implications for army ant symbionts, including ant-following birds, and for the animals hunted by these top predators.},

This paper addresses these problems, first by outlining an evolutionary theory of human warfare, and second by investigating the veracity of four common claims made against the use of evolutionary theory for explaining warfare. These claims are: (1) ancestral warfare was not frequent or intense enough to have selected for psychological adaptations in humans for warfare; (2) the existence of peaceful societies falsifies the claim that humans possess adaptations for fighting; (3) if psychological adaptations for warfare exist, then war is an inevitable and universal component of the human condition; (4) modern warfare and international politics is so qualitatively different from ancestral politics that any adaptations for the latter are inoperative or irrelevant today. By outlining an evolutionary theory of war and clarifying key misunderstandings regarding this approach, international relations scholars are better positioned to understand, engage, and contribute to emerging scholarship on human warfare across the social and evolutionary sciences.},

	abstract = {Arthropods are the most successful members of the animal kingdom largely because of their ability to move efﬁciently through a range of environments. Their agility has not been lost on engineers seeking to design agile legged robots. However, one cannot simply copy mechanical and neural control systems from insects into robotic designs. Rather one has to select the properties that are critical for speciﬁc behaviors that the engineer wants to capture in a particular robot. Convergent evolution provides an important clue to the properties of legged locomotion that are critical for success. Arthropods and vertebrates evolved legged locomotion independently. Nevertheless, many neural control properties and mechanical schemes are remarkably similar. Here we describe three aspects of legged locomotion that are found in both insects and vertebrates and that provide enhancements to legged robots. They are leg specialization, body ﬂexion and the development of a complex head structure. Although these properties are commonly seen in legged animals, most robotic vehicles have similar legs throughout, rigid bodies and rudimentary sensors on what would be considered the head region. We describe these convergent properties in the context of robots that we developed to capture the agility of insects in moving through complex terrain.},

It tends honeydew-producing Hemiptera to obtain carbohydrates and is also an effective predator and scavenger. What strategies does P. longicornis use to aid in hunting and scavenging? Our results show that as well as long-term recruitment to stable food sources, this species uses specialized short-term recruitment pheromones to recruit nest mates to assist in the exploitation of large food items. By mass, 88\% of externally carried food was retrieved cooperatively. Recruitment to large items is via a pheromone trail laid by the discovering ant. This trail is initially followed with few errors by naive recruits (82\% correct choices at a T-bifurcation) but decays very rapidly (within 6min). We also show that food-discovering ants can recruit nearby nest mates to a large food item without returning to the nest. These properties of the recruitment system are strikingly similar to 2 unrelated ant species, which also specialize in cooperative retrieval of large food items, suggesting convergent evolution. Lastly, we describe a novel “escort” behavior in which additional workers accompany a transported item but do not necessarily assist in carrying it. Both local recruitment and escorting are much more pronounced (3 and 4 times greater, respectively) when handling live prey. When an “escort” is present, live prey presented to the ants is 50\% more likely to be captured and is captured 4 times sooner and 50\% closer to the release point.},

	abstract = {Surveys of insect societies have revealed four key, recurring organizational trends: (i) The most elaborated cooperation occurs in groups of relatives. (ii) Cooperation is typically more elaborate in species with large colony sizes than in species with small colony sizes, the latter exhibiting greater internal reproductive conflict and lesser morphological and behavioral specialization. (iii) Within a species, per capita brood output typically declines as colony size increases. (iv). The ecological factors of resource patchiness and intergroup competition are associated with the most elaborated cooperation. Predictions of all four patterns emerge elegantly from a game-theoretic model in which within-group tug-of-wars are nested within a between-group tug-of-war. In this individual selection model, individuals are faced with the problem of how to partition their energy between investment in intercolony competition versus investment in intracolony competition, i.e., internal tugs-of-war over shares of the resources gained through intergroup competition. An individual's evolutionarily stable investment in between-group competition (i.e., within-group cooperation) versus within-group competition is shown to increase as within-group relatedness increases, to decrease as group size increases (for a fixed number of competing groups), to increase as the number of competing groups in a patch increases, and to decrease as between-group relatedness increases. Moreover, if increasing patch richness increases both the number of individuals within a group and the number of competing groups, greater overall cooperation within larger groups will be observed. The model presents a simple way of determining quantitatively how intergroup conflict will propel a society forward along a “superorganism continuum.”},

While warfare remains a contentious subject, considerable evidence supports the view that warfare is a strategy by which coalitions of males cooperate to acquire and defend resources necessary for reproduction. This strategy is not the result of a single “instinct” for war, but is instead an emergent property resulting from evolved psychological mechanisms (such as xenophobia and parochial altruism). These mechanisms are sensitive to ecological and social conditions, such that the prevalence and patterns of warfare vary according to subsistence strategies, military technology, cultural institutions, and political and economic relations. When economic conditions enable intergroup relations to change from zero-sum to positive-sum games, peaceful intergroup relations can emerge.},

	abstract = {Territorial behavior is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, with responses to conspecific intruders differing depending on various ecological, life history, and social factors. One factor which has received considerable research attention is rival identity. Early work provided many examples of species exhibiting relatively stronger responses to strangers versus neighbors (the “dear-enemy” effect) or the opposite (the “nasty-neighbor” effect). However, those studies focused predominantly on single or pair-bonded territory-holders. There is increasing evidence of neighbor–stranger response differences in group-living species (where 3 or more individuals share a territory), and of within-species variation in the relative responses shown to these 2 intruder types. Considering social species is important both because group territoriality is widespread and because group responses include the actions of multiple individuals whose interests and motivations differ. We begin our review with a summary of territoriality in group-living species. We then discuss causes of variation in territorial responses depending on intruder neighbor–stranger identity, considering both between-species differences and those within species arising from context-dependent variation and from individual group members responding differently to the same intrusion. We next detail the consequences of different territorial responses, in terms of both postinteraction behavior and individual benefits and costs. Finally, we suggest 3 key areas—theoretical modeling, hormonal mechanisms, and anthropogenic disturbances—that could be developed when considering the relative responses of territory-holders to neighbors and strangers. Since conflict is a powerful selective force, determining the causes and consequences of variation in group-territorial behavior is important for a full understanding of sociality.},

	abstract = {Adequate waste management is vital for the success of social life, because waste accumulation increases sanitary risks in dense societies. We explored why different leaf-cutting ants (LCA) species locate their waste in internal nest chambers or external piles, including ecological context and accounting for phylogenetic relations. We propose that waste location depends on whether the environmental conditions enhance or reduce the risk of infection. We obtained the geographical range, habitat and refuse location of LCA from published literature, and experimentally determined whether pathogens on ant waste survived to the high soil temperatures typical of xeric habitats. The habitat of the LCA determined waste location after phylogenetic correction: species with external waste piles mainly occur in xeric environments, whereas those with internal waste chambers mainly inhabit more humid habitats. The ancestral reconstruction suggests that dumping waste externally is less derived than digging waste nest chambers. Empirical results showed that high soil surface temperatures reduce pathogen prevalence from LCA waste. We proposed that LCA living in environments unfavourable for pathogens (i.e. xeric habitats) avoid digging costs by dumping the refuse above ground. Conversely, in environments suitable for pathogens, LCA species prevent the spread of diseases by storing waste underground, presumably, a behaviour that contributed to the colonization of humid habitats. These results highlight the adaptation of organisms to the hygienic challenges of social living, and illustrate how sanitary behaviours can result from a combination of evolutionary history and current environmental conditions.},

In certain circumstances, however, cooperation can arise between social groups. Here, we examine the circumstances under which inter-group cooperation is expected to emerge and present examples with particular focus on groups in two well-studied but dissimilar taxa: humans and ants. Drivers for the evolution of inter-group cooperation include overarching threats from predators, competitors or adverse conditions, and group-level resource asymmetries. Resources can differ between groups in both quantity and type. Where the difference is in type, inequalities can lead to specialization and division of labour between groups, a phenomenon characteristic of human societies, but rarely seen in other animals. The ability to identify members of one's own group is essential for social coherence; we consider the proximate roles of identity effects in shaping inter-group cooperation and allowing membership of multiple groups. Finally, we identify numerous valuable avenues for future research that will improve our understanding of the processes shaping inter-group cooperation.},

Other authors claim that warfare is a recent phenomenon, linked to the emergence of agriculture, and mostly explained by cultural rather than evolutionary forces. Here I highlight and critically evaluate six controversial points on the evolutionary bases of warfare. I argue that cultural and evolutionary explanations on the emergence of warfare are not alternative but analyze biological diversity at two distinct levels. An evolved propensity to act aggressively toward outgroup individuals may emerge irrespective of whether warfare appeared early/late during human evolution.

	abstract = {Intergroup conflict has been suggested as a major force shaping the evolution of social behaviour in animal groups. A long-standing hypothesis is that groups at risk of attack by rivals should become more socially cohesive, to increase resilience or protect against future attack. However, it is usually unclear how cohesive behaviours (such as grooming or social contacts) function in intergroup conflict. We performed an experiment in which we exposed young colonies of the dampwood termite, Zootermopsis angusticollis, to a rival colony while preventing physical combat with a permeable barrier. We measured social contacts, allogrooming and trophallaxis before, during and after exposure. Termites showed elevated rates of social contacts during exposure to a rival compared to the pre-exposure phase, but rates returned to pre-exposure levels after colonies were separated for 9 days. There was evidence of a delayed effect of conflict on worker trophallaxis. We suggest that social contacts during intergroup conflict function as a form of social surveillance, to check individual identity and assess colony resource holding potential. Intergroup conflict may increase social cohesion in both the short and the long term, improving the effectiveness of groups in competition.},

	abstract = {In international relations, unlike the natural sciences, there are few fundamental principles or laws. The world map, however, reveals at least one iron law of global politics: human territoriality. Almost every inch of the globe is partitioned into exclusive and bounded spaces that “belong” to specific groups of humans. Any that is not—such as Kashmir, Jerusalem, and the South China Sea—remains hotly contested. Throughout history, territory has led to recurrent and severe conflict. States are prepared to go to war, and individuals are prepared to die, even over land with little intrinsic value. While such behavior presents a puzzle for international relations theory, a broader evolutionary perspective reveals that territorial behavior has the following three characteristics: (1) it is common across the animal kingdom, suggesting a convergent solution to a common strategic problem; (2) it is a dominant strategy in the “hawk-dove” game of evolutionary game theory (under certain well-defined conditions); and (3) it follows a strategic logic, but one calibrated to cost-benefit ratios that prevailed in our evolutionary past, not those of the present. These insights generate novel predictions about when territorial conflict is more or less likely to occur in international relations.},

The philosophical dispute between vitalistic and mechanistic psychologists did much to obscure the problems of ‘ instinctive ’ behaviour. Though a thoroughly scientific approach to these problems is clearly expressed in the writings of Charles Darwin, zoologists were slow to recognize behaviour as a subject worthy of investigation. A special tribute is due to the ornithologists, whose intense pleasure and interest in just watching birds was instrumental in re-discovering of the fact that biological approach and method can successfully be applied in the study of behaviour, exactly as Darwin had done in his book, The expression of the emotions in man and animals.

Since Homo sapiens is exceptional among the creatures in so far as he deliberately destroys his own species in internecine war, and since he has now the capacity for annihilation it becomes necessary to ritualize his acquired habits of self-destruction. That means contriving intra-species relationships as sensibly as do the animals and observing the Law of the Jungle, by which no predator ever exterminates the species on which it preys nor vents its aggressive instincts to the hazard of its own kind. ‘War is Nature’s pruning hook’, said Sir Arthur Keith (1927). That was a strange interpretation of ‘the survival of the fittest’, but it was the kind of statement which could be invoked as scientific ‘authority’ for accepting mutual destruction as an innate characteristic and for regarding war as part of the mechanism of natural selection rather than as a temporary deviation.},

	abstract = {Studies on the social insects (ants, bees, wasps, and termites) have focused increasingly on sociogenesis, the process by which colony members undergo changes in caste, behavior, and physical location incident to colonial development. Caste is determined in individuals largely by environmental cues that trigger a sequence of progressive physiological restrictions. Individual determination, which is socially mediated, yields an age-size frequency distribution of the worker population that enhances survival and reproduction of the colony as a whole, typically at the expense of individuals. This "adaptive demography" varies in a predictable manner according to the species and size of the colony. The demography is richly augmented by behavioral pacemaking on the part of certain castes and programmed changes in the physical position of colony members according to age and size. Much of what has been observed in these three colony-level traits (adaptive demography, pacemaking, and positional effects) can be interpreted as the product of ritualization of dominance and other forms of selfish behavior that is still found in the more primitive insect societies. Some of the processes can also be usefully compared with morphogenesis at the levels of cells and tissues.},

	doi = {10.1242/jeb.098301},
	abstract = {Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside workers, and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.},

While paper wasps recognize each other individually through their facial markings, the ant, Pachycondyla villosa, uses chemical cues. In both species, individual recognition is adaptive since it facilitates the maintenance of stable dominance hierarchies among individuals, and thus reduces the cost of conflict within these small societies. Here, we investigated individual recognition in Pachycondyla ants by quantifying the level of aggression between pairs of familiar or unfamiliar queens over time. We show that unrelated founding queens of P. villosa and Pachycondyla inversa store information on the individual identity of other queens and can retrieve it from memory after 24 h of separation. Thus, we have documented for the first time that long-term memory of individual identity is present and functional in ants. This novel finding represents an advance in our understanding of the mechanism determining the evolution of cooperation among unrelated individuals.},

In social insects this has frequently led to a pronounced queen-worker dichotomy and a loss of reproductive totipotency among workers. However, in some invertebrate and all vertebrate societies, all or most individuals remain reproductively totipotent. In these groups, conflicts of interest over reproduction are potentially greatest. Here, we synthesize previous analyses of reproductive conflict, aggression and breeder replacement in haplodiploid societies of totipotent individuals and extend them to cover diploid (vertebrate) examples. We test predictions arising from this approach using the best-studied invertebrate (Dinoponera queenless ants) and vertebrate (naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber) examples, although in principle our analysis applies to all similar groups. We find that premature replacement of a parent breeder by nonbreeders (overthrow) is rare. Dominant coercive control of nonbreeders by the breeder is often unnecessary and honest signalling of breeder vitality can maintain group stability and resolve conflicts over reproduction. We hope that by providing an explicit transfer of social theory between ants and naked mole-rats we will stimulate further cross-taxonomic studies that will greatly broaden our understanding of sociality.},

Another major theme is the evolution of altruistic behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self. These themes are often assumed to be strongly linked, such that altruism is required for group‐level adaptation. Multilevel selection theory reveals a more complex relationship between the themes of altruism and organism. Adaptation at every level of the biological hierarchy requires a corresponding process of natural selection, which includes the fundamental ingredients of phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. These ingredients can exist for many kinds of groups and do not require the extreme genetic variation among groups that is usually associated with the evolution of altruism. Thus, it is reasonable to expect higher‐level units to evolve into adaptive units with respect to specific traits, even when their members are not genealogically related and do not behave in ways that are obviously altruistic. As one example, the concept of a group mind, which has been well documented in the social insects, may be applicable to other species.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00114-004-0529-5},
	abstract = {How sterile, altruistic worker castes have evolved in social insects and how they are maintained have long been central topics in evolutionary biology. With the advance of kin selection theory, insect societies, in particular those of haplodiploid bees, ants, and wasps, have become highly suitable model systems for investigating the details of social evolution and recently also how within-group conflicts are resolved. Because insect societies typically do not consist of clones, conflicts among nestmates arise, for example about the partitioning of reproduction and the allocation of resources towards male and female sexuals. Variation in relatedness among group members therefore appears to have a profound influence on the social structure of groups. However, insect societies appear to be remarkably robust against such variation: division of labor and task allocation are often organized in more or less the same way in societies with high as in those with very low nestmate relatedness. To explain the discrepancy between predictions from kin structure and empirical data, it was suggested that constraints-such as the lack of power or information-prevent individuals from pursuing their own selfish interests. Applying a multilevel selection approach shows that these constraints are in fact group-level adaptation preventing or resolving intracolonial conflict. The mechanisms of conflict resolution in insect societies are similar to those at other levels in the biological hierarchy (e.g., in the genome or multicellular organisms): alignment of interests, fair lottery, and social control. Insect societies can thus be regarded as a level of selection with novelties that provide benefits beyond the scope of a solitary life. Therefore, relatedness is less important for the maintenance of insect societies, although it played a fundamental role in their evolution.},

We propose a deﬁnition based instead on the evolutionary criteria of alignment of ﬁtness, export of ﬁtness by germ-soma specialization, and adaptive functional organization. We consider how these concepts apply to various putative individual organisms. We conclude that complex multicellular organisms and colonies of eusocial insects satisfy these three criteria, but that, in most cases (with at least one notable exception), colonies of modular organisms and genetic chimeras do not. While species do not meet these criteria, they may meet the criteria for a broader concept—that of an evolutionary individual—and sexual reproduction may be a species-level exaptation for enhancing evolvability. We also review the costs and beneﬁts of internal genetic heterogeneity within putative individuals, demonstrating that high relatedness is neither a necessary nor a sufﬁcient condition for individuality, and that, in some cases, genetic variability may have adaptive beneﬁts at the level of the whole.},

This paper revisits the positive peace index (PPI) introduced by the Institute for Economy and Peace (IEP) through the lens of systems thinking and modeling. Three sets of systems tools (cross-impact analysis, network analysis, and system dynamics) are proposed to explicitly account for the different levels of influence and dependence among the eight domains used to determine the PPI at the country level. Although more comprehensive than the original IEP formulation, the integrated approach proposed herein requires decisionmakers to be systems thinkers and able to conduct a detailed analysis of how the eight domains influence (impact) or depend on (sensitive to) each other. The proposed approach allows decisionmakers to capture the multidimensional and cross-disciplinary nature of positive peace better. This paper also shows that the three components of peace (positive, negative, and cultural) initially proposed by Johan Galtung can be represented using three-dimensional geometric features.},

Reductions in the diversity and abundance of native ants resulting from ant invasions give rise to a variety of direct and indirect effects on non-ant taxa. Invasive ants compete with and prey upon a diversity of other organisms, including some vertebrates, and may enter into or disrupt mutualistic interactions with numerous plants and other insects.

T. arizonensis workers attempted to rescue their brood by carrying them to ad-hoc shelters under rocks above ground, but the army ants pursued the workers to retrieve much of the brood. Raids on single colonies lasted about half an hour, after which the escaped T. arizonensis workers returned to their nest with any rescued brood. Raids on single nests occurred repeatedly during the 24-hour period the army ants swept through the T. arizonensis nest aggregation. Compared to unraided colonies, raided colonies were left with only about 25 \% of their brood. Army ant predation thus is an important source of brood loss to T. arizonensis and probably also to all attine ant species.

Brood is invaluable for the survival of social insect colonies and brood theft is well documented in ants. In many species the stolen brood act as slaves in the thief colony as they take up tasks related to foraging, defence and colony maintenance. Slave-making (dulotic) ants are at an advantage as they gain workforce without investing in rearing immature young, and several slave-making species have been recorded in temperate regions. In the current study we investigate brood theft in a primitively eusocial ponerine ant Diacamma indicum that inhabits the tropics. In the context of colony relocation we asked how thieves steal brood and what victim colonies do to prevent theft. While exposed nests increased colonies’ vulnerability, the relocation process itself did not enhance the chances of theft. Various aggressive interactions, in particular immobilization of intruders helped in preventing theft. Thieves that acted quickly, stayed furtive and stole unguarded brood were found to be successful. This comprehensive study of behavioural mechanism of theft reveals that these are the ‘tricks’ adopted by thieves.},

This paper seeks to explain the contribution of complexity theory to the understanding of the international system and its change. Firstly, it justifies the need for a new approach in IR theorization in the light of the limits of conventional IR theories as well as of the changing patterns from linearity to nonlinearity.

In social insects, resource limitation has been suggested as a possible cause for the typical decrease in per capita productivity observed with increasing colony size, a phenomenon known as Michener's paradox. Polydomy (distribution of a colony's brood and workers across multiple nests) is believed to help circumvent this paradox through its positive effect on foraging efficiency, but there is still little supporting evidence for this hypothesis. Here, we show experimentally that polydomy enhances the foraging performance of food-deprived Temnothorax nylanderi ant colonies via several mechanisms. First, polydomy influences task allocation within colonies, resulting in faster retrieval of protein resources. Second, communication between sister nests reduces search times for far away resources. Third, colonies move queens, brood and workers across available nest sites in response to spatial heterogeneities in protein and carbohydrate resources. This suggests that polydomy represents a flexible mechanism for space occupancy, helping ant colonies adjust to the environment.},

	abstract = {A challenge faced by individuals and groups of many species is determining how resources and activities should be spatially distributed: centralized or decentralized. This distribution problem is hard to understand due to the many costs and benefits of each strategy in different settings. Ant colonies are faced by this problem and demonstrate two solutions: 1) centralizing resources in a single nest (monodomy) and 2) decentralizing by spreading resources across many nests (polydomy). Despite the possibilities for using this system to study the centralization/decentralization problem, the trade-offs associated with using either polydomy or monodomy are poorly understood due to a lack of empirical data and cohesive theory. Here, we present a dynamic network model of a population of ant nests which is based on observations of a facultatively polydomous ant species (Formica lugubris). We use the model to test several key hypotheses for costs and benefits of polydomy and monodomy and show that decentralization is advantageous when resource acquisition costs are high, nest size is limited, resources are clustered, and there is a risk of nest destruction, but centralization prevails when resource availability fluctuates and nest size is limited. Our model explains the phylogenetic and ecological diversity of polydomous ants, demonstrates several trade-offs of decentralization and centralization, and provides testable predictions for empirical work on ants and in other systems.},

The presence of territorial species considerably alters the behavior of co-occurring submissives, as it is known in several submissive ant species living on the territories of red wood ants in temperate regions. On the other hand, as a rule, territorial species cannot share the same territory and usually exclude each other. However, this ‘rule’ is inferred from the almost complete lack of data on the coexistence of rival territorials, and not from observations regarding the effective exclusion or behavioral inhibition of one territorial species by other. In the frame of this study, we investigated the foraging strategy of the territorial red wood ant Formica pratensis that occurred inside a large polydomous system of another territorial ant species, F. exsecta. Formica pratensis colonies outside the supercolony served as control. Within the F. exsecta supercolony, F. pratensis showed the characteristics of a subordinate species characterized by low discovery and exploitation success of artificial food sources. On the contrary, control colonies outside the polydomous system clearly behaved like typical territorials as they successfully monopolized the majority of the baits. In addition, submissive species were more successful around the F. pratensis nests within the supercolony, than outside of it. As suggested by our results, territorial species could co-occur with other territorials given certain plasticity in their behavior and small colony size. Nevertheless, exclusion also happens as proven by our field observations.},

	abstract = {Most ant colonies live in a single nest (monodomy) or a group of nests (polydomy). However, the length of time for which nests are inhabited varies significantly between different species. Although colonies of some species frequently move nest sites, in others, colonies inhabit the same nest or group of nests for many years. Similarly, in some species foraging and resource-sharing trails are highly dynamic, while in other species trails are used for years. Wood ants are a group of keystone species that inhabit many northern hemisphere woodlands, where they are important predators of invertebrates and indirectly act as herbivores through the farming of aphids. Wood ant colonies exhibit both monodomy and polydomy, and can inhabit nests for many years. Trails in wood ant colonies are also thought to be relatively stable. However, information about colony dynamics is mostly anecdotal as, until now, no longitudinal datasets have been collected. In this study, we collected data from ten polydomous wood ant colonies annually for 8 years and a subset of four colonies 16 times over 2 years. We found that most polydomous wood ant nests are abandoned in the first 2 years after being constructed and are more likely to be abandoned in the latter part of the active season. However, the rate of nest abandonment decreases after 2 years and is lower in larger nests. We also found that wood ant trails are relatively static within an active season and become more static later in the season as trails become established.},

	abstract = {Animal social structure is shaped by environmental conditions, such as food availability. This is important as conditions are likely to change in the future and changes to social structure can have cascading ecological effects. Wood ants are a useful taxon for the study of the relationship between social structure and environmental conditions, as some populations form large nest networks and they are ecologically dominant in many northern hemisphere woodlands. Nest networks are formed when a colony inhabits more than one nest, known as polydomy. Polydomous colonies are composed of distinct sub-colonies that inhabit spatially distinct nests and that share resources with each other. In this study, we performed a controlled experiment on 10 polydomous wood ant (Formica lugubris) colonies to test how changing the resource environment affects the social structure of a polydomous colony. We took network maps of all colonies for 5 years before the experiment to assess how the networks changes under natural conditions. After this period, we prevented ants from accessing an important food source for a year in five colonies and left the other five colonies undisturbed. We found that preventing access to an important food source causes polydomous wood ant colony networks to fragment into smaller components and begin foraging on previously unused food sources. These changes were not associated with a reduction in the growth of populations inhabiting individual nests (sub-colonies), foundation of new nests or survival, when compared with control colonies. Colony splitting likely occurred as the availability of food in each nest changed causing sub-colonies to change their inter-nest connections. Consequently, our results demonstrate that polydomous colonies can adjust to environmental changes by altering their social network.},

	abstract = {Polydomy, a single colony spread between multiple nests, is a widespread life history strategy in ants. The mechanisms by which a polydomous colony functions, and the fitness benefits this nesting strategy provides, are poorly understood. Here we review what is known about polydomy in the well-studied and ecologically important Formica rufa group. We focus particularly on the ecological fitness benefits polydomy may provide to members of the F. rufa group. We discuss the well-documented association in this group between polygyny (multiple queens in a colony) and polydomy, and how this relationship may favour colony reproduction by budding. We argue that although polygyny and reproduction by budding may drive a colony to  spread between multiple nests, the maintenance of prolonged communication between these nests needs further explanation in terms of fitness benefits. The potential benefits of polydomy in the F. rufa group are discussed, specifically how polydomy may help a colony: exploit resources, dominate spaces,
or lower the cost of stochastic nest destruction. The potential consequences of polydomy for the social organisation of a colony are explored. We also highlight gaps in current knowledge, and suggest future research directions.},

The study is based on electrophoretically analysed enzyme polymorphisms. The patterns of genotypic variation among single-nest workers suggest that polygyny is functional in all the three species. The observed genotype frequencies indicate outbreeding within the study areas, and no spatial microdifferentiation in gene frequencies is detected. The coexistent gynes in nests of both F. transkaucasica and F. polyctena are genetically related to each other, and the same holds for worker nest mates. These results support the hypothesis that polygyny is favoured by kin selection. The lack of genetic relatedness among gyne nest mates in the highly polygynous F. aquilonia suggests that additional factors, such as mutualism or parental parasitism, are probably involved in the evolution of polygyny.},

	abstract = {Colonial identity in social insects is based on nestmate recognition which is mediated through cuticular substances. Although this is considered to be distinct from kin recognition, it is possible that through evolution the signal mediating kinship was replaced by the signal mediating “nestmateship”. Cuticular hydrocarbons in Cataglyphis niger are responsible for modifying the ant’s aggressive behavior and are considered to have a similar function in other ants species. In ants, the postpharyngeal gland (PPG) serves as a storage organ for these cues and functions as a “gestalt” organ, with the gestalt being permanently updated. Its content is constantly being exchanged with nestmates through trophallaxis and allogrooming. We hypothesize that already in the primitive ponerine ants the PPG evolved as a gestalt organ even without trophallaxis. We discuss two alternative primary selective pressures for the evolution of trophallaxis: facilitating food exchange versus exchanging recognition cues. Callow workers seem to be characterized by a “cuticular chemical insignificance” followed by a “chemical integration” period when they acquire the gestalt of the colony and learn the associated template. We hypothesize that the template has evolved from a simple personal chemical reference in primitive species with small colonies to an internal representation of the colonial identity in larger colonies.},

We know little about how states in other species showing various degrees of apparent similarity to human pain states are related to human pain, or how the mechanisms essential for pain-related states evolved. Nevertheless, insights into the evolution of mechanisms and behaviour important for pain are beginning to emerge from wide-ranging investigations of cellular mechanisms and behavioural responses linked to nociceptor activation, tissue injury, inflammation and the environmental context of these responses in diverse species. In February 2019, an unprecedented meeting on the evolution of pain hosted by the Royal Society brought together scientists from disparate fields who investigate nociception and pain-related behaviour in crustaceans, insects, leeches, gastropod and cephalopod molluscs, fish and mammals (primarily rodents and humans). Here, we identify evolutionary themes that connect these research efforts, including adaptive and maladaptive features of pain-related behavioural and neuronal alterations—some of which are quite general, and some that may apply primarily to humans. We also highlight major questions, including how pain should be defined, that need to be answered as we seek to understand the evolution of pain.

The absence in a given species of a homologous neural architecture strongly correlated with a type of conscious experience in humans should be able to be taken as a prima facie reason for concluding that the species in question does not have the capacity for that conscious experience. Absence of evidence reasoning is, however, widely disparaged for being both logically illicit and unscientific. This paper argues that these concerns are unwarranted. There is no logical barrier to formulating cogent absence of evidence arguments; indeed, accepting such arguments is part of what it is to be committed to falsifiability as a critical aspect of the scientific method. Absence of evidence arguments can always be blocked, however, by assuming that psychological properties are ‘multiply realizable’. While we take multiple realizability to be highly likely at some level of analysis, we argue that it is question-begging to assume that it exists at every level of analysis, and thus it should not automatically be thought to undermine absence of evidence reasoning in the animal consciousness debate. Using the example of pain and focusing on homologies at the level of information processing tasks, we show how, in the science of consciousness, an absence of evidence might well serve as evidence of absence.},

Hence, for aggression to be evolutionarily adaptive, animals must decide when best to flee, rather than fight. How its done, is arguably best understood in crickets. These insects implement the decision by simply modulating the behavioural threshold to flee. This threshold is raised by potentially rewarding experiences (e. g. resource possession), via the amine octopamine, so that the animal is less prone to flee and persists longer in fighting. Conversely, the threshold is lowered by nitric oxide, released in response to aversive stimuli (e. g. the opponent’s agonistic signals), thus increasing the tendency to flee. A cricket then flees, when the sum of its opponent’s actions exceeds the threshold. Subsequently, serotonin keeps the threshold low, so that losers remain submissive; possibly by inhibiting dopamine, which is necessary for recovery of aggression in losers.},

How do biological systems achieve efficient transportation networks in the absence of centralized control and without global knowledge of the environment? Here, we address this question by studying the formation and properties of inter-nest transportation networks in the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We find that the formation of inter-nest networks depends on the number of ants involved in the construction process. When the number of ants is sufficient and networks do form, they tend to have short total length but a low level of robustness. These networks are topologically similar to either minimum spanning trees or Steiner networks. The process of network formation involves an initial construction of multiple links followed by a pruning process that reduces the number of trails. Our study thus illuminates the conditions under and the process by which minimal biological transport networks can be constructed.},

	abstract = {Animals live in heterogeneous environments where food resources are transient and have to be exploited rapidly. Ants show a wide range of foraging strategies and this activity is tightly regulated irrespective of the mode of recruitment used. Individual foragers base their decision to forage on information received from nestmates (social information). Transmission of information can be in the form of direct physical interactions such as antennation or indirect exchange of information such as laying of pheromone trails. Foragers also rely on information from their internal states or experience (personal information). The interaction between these two sources of information gives rise to plasticity in foraging behaviour. Recent studies have examined the role of personality (consistent inter-individual variation in behavioural traits) during ant foraging. Since colonies differ from each other in the distribution of personalities of their members, colonies may consistently differ in behavioural traits, giving rise to colony level personality. However, the interaction between information use and personality, especially at the individual level, remains unexplored. Here, we briefly summarize the literature on the effect of social and personal information on the regulation of ant foraging and the effect of personality on this behaviour. We point out that a more focused examination of the interplay between personality and information use will help us understand how behavioural plasticity in the context of foraging in is shaped at the colony and individual levels.},

However, the role of ecology in the evolution of specialized altruistic phenotypes or ‘castes’, a recurrent theme in insect societies, is poorly understood. 2 Cephalotes ants nest in pre-existing arboreal cavities, and extant species span four incremental steps in the evolution of a soldier caste that is morphologically specialized for blocking cavity entrances. I address the hypothesis that ecological specialization, defined as specialized use of cavities with entrances close to the area of one ant head, has selected for a morphologically and behaviourally specialized soldier in Cephalotes. This is done with comparative studies of four Cephalotes species, with one representative for each of the four character states of soldier evolution. 3 By quantifying nesting ecology, nest defence and foraging behaviour, I provide strong support for two key predictions of the focal hypothesis. First, the least specialized nesting ecology is seen in the species with the ancestral state of no-soldier. Thus, more individuals are needed to block the average entrance than in other species, and the variation in entrance area is also greater. Second, a systematic increase in ecological specialization (lower mean and variance of entrance area), and behavioural specialization of soldiers, is associated with each of the three transitions to more specialized soldier morphology. This pattern culminates in the consistent use of cavities with an entrance area equal to one soldier head, and a strict soldier-only blocking defence, in the species representing the most specialized and derived soldier morphology. All species used some entrances equal to one ant head, thus it was specifically the specialization on such nests that was associated with increased morphological and behavioural specialization of the soldier. 4 Overall, theses findings provide strong comparative support for the hypothesis that ecological specialization has played a key role in the evolution of a specialized soldier caste in Cephalotes. This pattern is opposite to classic theoretical prediction that a broader resource base should select for caste evolution. The idea that ecological specialization could be a general force in caste evolution is explored, with critical comparative and experimental tests discussed.},

	abstract = {Antipredation behaviours of three ant species of the genus Camponotus were investigated in field and laboratory studies. Contact with the army ant Neivamyrmex nigrescens was shown to produce nest evacuation and removal of brood by colonies of Camponotus festinatus. Colonies of Camponotus ocreatus and Camponotus vicinus defended their nests through recruitment of the major caste. The initiation of evacuation or aggressive recruitment was dependent upon tactile contacts between Camponotus nestmates. Other sorts of disturbance which did not involve army ant contact did not produce evacuation or recruitment, indicating a high degree of enemy specification by Camponotus. The comparison of worker morphology revealed a close relationship between each species' strategy for nest defence and the degree of worker polymorphism exhibited. These findings suggest that interspecific ant predation has been a significant factor in the evolution of colony defence systems and caste polymorphism.},

Of the species tested, the Argentine ant was most susceptible to the venom. On a weight-adjusted basis the red imported fire ant was 330 times more resistant to the venom than the Argentine ant. In addition, the native southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni McCook, was significantly more susceptible to the venom than S. invicta. Formica perpilosa Wheeler was most resistant to the venom when the LD50 was not adjusted for weight, requiring a dose 684 times higher than that of the Argentine ant. When we tested synthetic venom (solenopsin A, which is the main component of S. xyloni venom) against the Argentine ant, the LD50 value was unchanged. However, both S. invicta and S. xyloni were ≈6 times more susceptible to the synthetic compound than to natural venom. Therefore, S. invicta venom is less toxic to fire ants while being just as toxic to Argentine ants as the simpler, more primitive venom of S. xyloni. Fire ant gaster flagging and venom dabbing applies enough venom to the Argentine ant to be lethal and may help explain the superior interference competition shown by the red imported fire ant.},

Days-old workers responded to aggression by death feigning, weeks-old workers responded by fleeing and months-old workers responded by fighting back. By feigning death, days-old workers were four times more likely to survive aggression than older workers. From a proximate perspective, retaliation by young workers against aggressive older workers is certain to fail. With their relatively soft exoskeleton, young workers would be prone to injury and death and unable to execute an effective attack of biting or stinging older workers with harder exoskeletons. From an ultimate perspective, death feigning allows young workers to survive and contribute to brood care and colony growth, both of which are essential to queen survival and fitness.},

When N. compressinodis workers attacked W. auropunctata nests, the assaulted workers panicked and left the nests, some of them carrying brood. Nevertheless, during its raids on W. auropunctata, N. compressinodis was able to capture nearly all of the W. auropunctata brood and winged sexuals, whereas none of the attacks by N. compressinodis on other sympatric ant species were successful. Laboratory experiments revealed that the workers of eight compared sympatric species attacked the N. compressinodis individuals and that N. compressinodis workers accepted W. auropunctata brood as well as that of most of the tested species, showing that its speciﬁcity probably depends on the reaction of the W. auropunctata workers.},

However, individuals may differ in their propensity to recognise threats due to factors, often intercorrelated, such as caste, age and experience, and the ability to separate these is important for understanding why behaviours are expressed. Here, we use leaf-cutting ants in a controlled behavioural assay to tease apart the factors which likely affect threat response behaviours in social insect workers. We show that foraging workers respond to threats more readily than do within-nest workers. The response of all workers was greater towards more foreign stimuli—nestmates rarely stimulated a response, whereas ants of a different genus stimulated a response in most cases. We show that age and experience act separately to increase an individual’s ability to perceive the threat. This suggests that where multiple, compounding factors affect the expression of certain behaviours it is important to realise that these factors can also have independent effects, particularly those which correlate with age. Separating the influence of correlating factors experimentally, as shown here, is particularly useful for understanding why individuals may differ in their behavioural profile.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Oecophylla species are among the most iconic tropical ants, but a broad review of their biology has been lacking. The two living species of Oecophylla are widespread in the Old World tropics and are similar in presenting the most sophisticated nest-building activities of all weaver ants. Workers draw leaves together, often forming long chains, and glue them together with larval silk. Chain formation promises to provide a major subject for the development of models of the self-organization of complex behavior. The colonies are very large and highly polydomous. Queens are predominantly though not exclusively once-mated and colonies are usually single-queened, but most Northern Territory (Australia) colonies are polygynous. The workers are highly polymorphic (seen also in a fossilized colony), show complex polyethism, and present a much-studied rich pheromonal repertoire for the colony's tasks. Colony odor is partly learned, showing a "nasty neighbor" effect in reactions to other colonies of this highly territorial ant, and partly intrinsic to each individual. The odor varies over time and differs between the nests of a colony. Not surprisingly, Oecophylla ants are hosts to a variety of inquilines, such as spiders, which mimic the colony odor to escape detection. In addition, a constellation of Homoptera benefit from ant protection, yet the activities of the ants in controlling pest species make these ants beneficial insects (they are also human food in some areas). We speculate that the existence of Oecophylla blocks other weaver ants from evolving highly complex social organization, an idea which could be tested with further knowledge on the timing of ant adaptive radiations.},

	volume = {91},
	abstract = {The evolution of territorial behavior requires that the beneﬁts of territoriality outweigh the costs. The costs are primarily those of territorial defense against encroaching neighbors or against ﬂoaters seeking to establish their own territory. One way to reduce the cost of defense might be to restrict serious conﬂict to encounters with those posing the greatest threat. Studies of many animals have found that less aggression is shown toward neighbors than toward strangers, a phenomenon known as the ‘‘dear enemy’’ effect. However, the opposite can also be true, namely, that more aggression is shown toward neighbors than strangers: the ‘‘nasty neighbor’’ effect. This may be particularly true of group-living species that defend a resource-based territory. Here we show that (1) colonies of the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina were able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighboring colonies as non-colony members; and (2) when recognized as non-colony members, more aggression was exhibited toward neighbors than non-neighbors. We present for the ﬁrst time evidence that differential levels of aggression involve both a perceptual and behavioral component. On the other hand, we found no evidence that weaver ant workers were better able to recognize workers from previously unknown colonies or responded more aggressively to them, even after a 10-day period of contact. This contrasts with other species in which rapid learning of the identity of new potential enemies has been demonstrated. We suggest that such a response is unnecessary for weaver ants, as encounters with intruders from non-neighboring colonies are probably rare and of little consequence. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the nasty neighbor effect may be much more common than the dear enemy effect among group-living species.},

	abstract = {In an ongoing study of the green ant, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), to control insect pests, we surveyed newly established ant colonies in a 3-year-old mango block in March 1997 at Howard Springs, Northern Territory. We also surveyed 12 established ant colonies from May to July 1997 in Darwin, and six of them were surveyed again in February 1998. the aims were to determine patterns of initial colonisation by dealate queens of O. smaragdina and to locate the queen ant nest in established colonies of the ant. the number of dealate queens in new communal nests varied from one to 15. In a total of 73 nests, 71\% of nests contained more than one dealate queen and 12\% of nests contained segments or corpses of dealate queens, which were either parasitised by a fungus or killed by predators. This confirms that pleometrosis during the initial establishment of a colony is very common in O. smaragdina, and suggests that natural enemies affect the success of initial colonisation. of 12 established green ant colonies, 10 colonies with two to six queens were all in one nest, and only two colonies had one queen. In those colonies with multiple queens, we found that each queen was almost equally attractive to the major workers. Contrary to previous reports, these data suggest that pleometrosis in O. smaragdina during the initial period of colony establishment can lead to polygyny in mature colonies. This is the first time that polygyny has been documented in mature colonies of O. smaragdina.},

	abstract = {Recognition systems involve 3 components: an expression component, a perception component, and an action or response component. Disentangling the perception component from the action component can be difficult, as the absence of a discriminatory response may result from either a difference in perception or action. Social insects generally defend their colony against intruding conspecifics and provide a useful model for exploring recognition systems. However, whether differences in behavior at the colony or individual level result from the perception or action component of the recognition system is largely unknown. Furthermore, variation at the individual level has remained largely unexplored because research on social insects often focuses on the colony rather than on the individual. Using some novel behavioral bioassays, we here show that variation in the aggressive behavior of individual weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina L.) arises more from the identity of the recipient than of the intruder and, contrary to previous findings, that this often results from perceptual differences. We suggest that recognition in weaver ants may involve a template based on the individual’s odor prior to intermingling with other odors rather than on a common odor. We also argue that a common odor might be more important for the survival of the colony than a shared template. Conversely, possessing a range of templates may provide a colony with additional fitness benefits. By focusing on the differences among individual workers within colonies, this study reveals complexities in nest mate recognition that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A comparative anthropological perspective reveals not only that some human societies do not engage in war, but also that peaceful social systems exist. Peace systems are defined as clusters of neighbouring societies that do not make war with each other. The mere existence of peace systems is important because it demonstrates that creating peaceful intergroup relationships is possible whether the social units are tribal societies, nations, or actors within a regional system. Peace systems have received scant scientific attention despite holding potentially useful knowledge and principles about how to successfully cooperate to keep the peace. Thus, the mechanisms through which peace systems maintain peaceful relationships are largely unknown. It is also unknown to what degree peace systems may differ from other types of social systems. This study shows that certain factors hypothesised to contribute to intergroup peace are more developed within peace systems than elsewhere. A sample consisting of peace systems scored significantly higher than a comparison group regarding overarching common identity; positive social interconnectedness; interdependence; non-warring values and norms; non-warring myths, rituals, and symbols; and peace leadership. Additionally, a machine learning analysis found non-warring norms, rituals, and values to have the greatest relative importance for a peace system outcome. These results have policy implications for how to promote and sustain peace, cohesion, and cooperation among neighbouring societies in various social contexts, including among nations. For example, the purposeful promotion of peace system features may facilitate the international cooperation necessary to address interwoven global challenges such as global pandemics, oceanic pollution, loss of biodiversity, nuclear proliferation, and climate change.},

	abstract = {Most multicellular animals belong to two evolutionary lineages, the Proto– and Deuterostomia, which diverged 640–760 million years (MYR) ago. Neuropeptide signaling is abundant in animals belonging to both lineages, but it is often unclear whether there exist evolutionary relationships between the neuropeptide systems used by proto-or deuterostomes. An exception, however, are members of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor superfamily, which occur in both evolutionary lineages, where GnRHs are the ligands in Deuterostomia and GnRH-like peptides, adipokinetic hormone (AKH), corazonin, and AKH/corazonin-related peptide (ACP) are the ligands in Protostomia. AKH is a well-studied insect neuropeptide that mobilizes lipids and carbohydrates from the insect fat body during flight. In our present paper, we show that AKH is not only widespread in insects, but also in other Ecdysozoa and in Lophotrochozoa. Furthermore, we have cloned and deorphanized two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the oyster Crassostrea gigas (Mollusca) that are activated by low nanomolar concentrations of oyster AKH (pQVSFSTNWGSamide). Our discovery of functional AKH receptors in molluscs is especially significant, because it traces the emergence of AKH signaling back to about 550 MYR ago and brings us closer to a more complete understanding of the evolutionary origins of the GnRH receptor superfamily.},

The paper begins with an overview of three of the main theoretical contributions of social psychology to the problem of inter-group conflict: social identity theory, stereotyping and prejudice, and contact theory. We then review how these theories have been applied by conflict resolution specialists in international and ethnic conflicts as they have sought to moderate intergroup hostilities in conflict zones. The paper concludes with an analysis of the gaps between theory and practice, namely: theory of change gap, transfer strategies gap, and unit of analysis gap. Finally, based on the reviewed social psychology research, the article makes policy recommendations about how these gaps between theory and practice can be narrowed.},

	abstract = {To advance our understanding of the causes and the consequences of budding (colony multiplication by fragmentation of main nests), we investigated nest movement in the facultatively polydomous Pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Demographic data revealed that Pharaoh ants are highly polygynous and have a relatively low worker to queen ratio of 12.86. Budding experiments demonstrated that the number of available bud nests has a signiﬁcant effect on colony fragmentation and increasing the number of bud nests resulted in smaller colony fragments. The overall distribution among bud nests was uneven, even though there was no evidence that the different life stages and castes partitioned unevenly among the bud nests and the analysis of individual colonies revealed no evidence of an uneven split in any of the colonies. This demonstrates that Pharaoh ants have the ability to exert social control over colony size and caste proportions during budding, which may contribute to their success as an invasive ant. The intensity of nest disturbance had a signiﬁcant effect on whether or not the ants migrated into bud nests. Major disturbance resulted in the ants abandoning the source nest and migrating to bud nests and minor disturbance did not stimulate the ants to abandon the source nest. The results of the successive budding experiment which allowed the ants the opportunity to bud into progressively smaller nest fragments demonstrate that Pharaoh ants maintain a preferred minimum group size of 469 Æ 28 individuals. Food allocation experiments utilizing protein marking revealed that nest fragmentation in Pharaoh ants has no negative impact on intracolony food distribution. Overall, our results suggest that nest units in the Pharaoh ant behave like cooperative, rather than competitive, entities. Such cooperation is most likely facilitated by the fact that individuals in all bud nests are genetically related, remain in close proximity to each other, and may continue to exchange individuals after budding.},

	abstract = {Unicolonial ant colonies occupy many nests and individuals rarely show aggression across large geographic distances. These traits make it difficult to detect colony structure. Here we identify colony structure at scales of hundreds of square-meters, within an invasive population of unicolonial Argentine ants. In experiments using labeled food, and in a 3-year census of nests and trails, we found that food was shared and nests were linked by trails at distances up to 50 meters. Food was not distributed to all nearby Argentine ant nests, showing that ants tend to share resources within a spatially bounded group of nests. The spatial extent of food sharing increased from winter to summer. Across different habitats and nest densities, nests were consistently aggregated at spatial scales of 3- 4 meters in radius. This suggests that new nests bud from old nests at short distances regardless of local conditions. We suggest that a  colony  of Argentine ants could be defined as a group of nests among which ants travel and share food. In our study population, colonies occupy up to 650 m2 and contain as many as 5 million ants. In combination with previous work showing that there is genetic differentiation among nests at similar spatial scales, the results suggest that Argentine ant populations do not function ecologically as single, large supercolonies, but instead as mosaics of smaller, distinct colonies consisting of groups of interacting nests.},

	abstract = {Abstract. 1. Colony organisation and movement behaviour of the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile) was studied over 3 years in field populations in California and in captive colonies in the laboratory. This invasive species is highly polydomous and unicolonial; colonies consist of expansive and fluid networks of nests and trails. The spatial and temporal organisation of colonies may contribute to ecological dominance. 2. Argentine ant nests and inter-nest trails shift in size, abundance, and location, so that colony networks are spatially contracted in the winter and expanded spring to autumn. Colonies occupy permanent sites; ants migrated to and from the same winter nest locations year after year, and occupied 30 \% of the same nests repeatedly during seasonal migrations. 3. Nests were moved on average 2 – 3 m. Forty-two per cent were occupied less than 1 month, 4 \% the entire study, and the other 54 \% lasted 3.9 ± 2.3 months (mean ± SD). 4. Nests were located within 2 – 4 m of woody plants, in warm sites in the winter and cool sites in the summer. Both humidity and food availability influenced nest-site choice in laboratory colonies. However, when faced with a trade-off between factors, the ants chose humid nest boxes over nest boxes near food, and ants moved nests only in response to changes in humidity and not distance to food. 5. The results indicate that L. humile colonies are seasonally polydomous, and that nest movements are driven by changes in microclimate. Colony organisation maintains high local density and increases food supply, which may improve the competitive ability of L. humile colonies and reduce opportunities for species coexistence.},

	abstract = {In eusocial insects, particularly in ants, caste differentiation is extremely complicated when we rely on traditional taxonomy. In most species, the worker caste does not display any distinct morphological characters neither the caste’s central division according to their morphological size variations. We used a landmark-based geometric morphometric approach to quantify the morphological characteristics of female caste systems (queen, major and minor worker ant) of Oecophylla smaragdina. Our findings suggested that each caste has its unique shape and size. Especially in the worker caste, apart from the size variations, we can use the shape as a prominent tool for distinguishing between them. The O. smaragdina exhibits a triphasic allometry pattern. Studying the allometry and non-allometry components of each caste system revealed a highly complex size and shape relationship in the female caste systems. From the allometric and non-allometric analysis, we concluded that the major worker ants showed a closer relationship with the queen than the minor worker ant. This outcome demonstrated that Asian weaver ant exhibits complex shape variations related to size and is correlated to their functional modular characters. This research sheds new light on caste systems’ taxonomic uncertainties for eusocial hymenopteran groups, especially ants.},

	abstract = {1 Ecology can have a profound influence on social evolution. However, the role of ecology in the evolution of specialized altruistic phenotypes or ‘castes’, a recurrent theme in insect societies, is poorly understood. 2 Cephalotes ants nest in pre-existing arboreal cavities, and extant species span four incremental steps in the evolution of a soldier caste that is morphologically specialized for blocking cavity entrances. I address the hypothesis that ecological specialization, defined as specialized use of cavities with entrances close to the area of one ant head, has selected for a morphologically and behaviourally specialized soldier in Cephalotes. This is done with comparative studies of four Cephalotes species, with one representative for each of the four character states of soldier evolution. 3 By quantifying nesting ecology, nest defence and foraging behaviour, I provide strong support for two key predictions of the focal hypothesis. First, the least specialized nesting ecology is seen in the species with the ancestral state of no-soldier. Thus, more individuals are needed to block the average entrance than in other species, and the variation in entrance area is also greater. Second, a systematic increase in ecological specialization (lower mean and variance of entrance area), and behavioural specialization of soldiers, is associated with each of the three transitions to more specialized soldier morphology. This pattern culminates in the consistent use of cavities with an entrance area equal to one soldier head, and a strict soldier-only blocking defence, in the species representing the most specialized and derived soldier morphology. All species used some entrances equal to one ant head, thus it was specifically the specialization on such nests that was associated with increased morphological and behavioural specialization of the soldier. 4 Overall, theses findings provide strong comparative support for the hypothesis that ecological specialization has played a key role in the evolution of a specialized soldier caste in Cephalotes. This pattern is opposite to classic theoretical prediction that a broader resource base should select for caste evolution. The idea that ecological specialization could be a general force in caste evolution is explored, with critical comparative and experimental tests discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the several reasons given in calls for the prohibition of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) is that they are against human dignity (Asaro in Int Rev Red Cross 94(886):687–709, 2012; Docherty in Shaking the foundations: the human rights implications of killer robots, Human Rights Watch, New York, 2014; Heyns in S Afr J Hum Rights 33(1):46–71, 2017; Ulgen in Human dignity in an age of autonomous weapons: are we in danger of losing an ‘elementary consideration of humanity’? 2016). However there have been criticisms of the reliance on human dignity in arguments against AWS (Birnbacher in Autonomous weapons systems: law, ethics, policy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2016; Pop in Autonomous weapons systems: a threat to human dignity? 2018; Saxton in (Un)dignified killer robots? The problem with the human dignity argument, 2016). This paper critically examines the relationship between human dignity and AWS. Three main types of objection to AWS are identified; (i) arguments based on technology and the ability of AWS to conform to international humanitarian law; (ii) deontological arguments based on the need for human judgement and meaningful human control, including arguments based on human dignity; (iii) consequentialist reasons about their effects on global stability and the likelihood of going to war. An account is provided of the claims made about human dignity and AWS, of the criticisms of these claims, and of the several meanings of ‘dignity’. It is concluded that although there are several ways in which AWS can be said to be against human dignity, they are not unique in this respect. There are other weapons, and other technologies, that also compromise human dignity. Given this, and the ambiguities inherent in the concept, it is wiser to draw on several types of objections in arguments against AWS, and not to rely exclusively on human dignity.},

This development cannot be ignored by war crimes lawyers. Philosophers on both sides of these debates as well as many lawyers understand the attacked principles to provide the moral underpinning of the contemporary war crimes regime. This perceived tension is erroneous. A panoramic view of the applicable law reveals it to be more revisionist in its moral posture than is ordinarily recognized. First, increasing recognition of the applicability of international human rights law in armed conflict reflects growing skepticism of the normative exceptionalism of war. Second, the criminalization of aggression reflects the moral inequality of combatants. Third, the legal distinction between civilians and combatants is understood best through a combination of individual liability and necessity—principles that can be accommodated in more nuanced ways as human rights law gains traction. Gaps remain, but there is more common ground between international law and revisionist theory than either lawyers or theorists tend to recognize.},

	abstract = {Both academic publications and public media often make inappropriate use of incommensurate conflict statistics, creating misleading impressions about patterns in global warfare. This article clarifies the distinction between combatant deaths, battle deaths, and war deaths. A new dataset of battle deaths in armed conflict is presented for the period 1946-2002. Global battle deaths have been decreasing over most of this period, mainly due to a decline in interstate and internationalised civil armed conflict. It is far more difficult to accurately assess the number of war deaths in conflicts both past and present. But there are compelling reasons to believe that there is a need for increased attention to non-battle causes of mortality, especially displacement and disease in conflict studies. Therefore, it is demographers, public health specialists, and epidemiologists who can best describe the true human cost of many recent armed conflicts and assess the actions necessary to reduce that toll.},

Each war is characterized as interstate, colonial, or imperial, and major power status and/or central system membership of the warring parties is noted. Part 2, the Civil Wars file, describes when and where fighting took place, whether the war was fought within the boundaries of a major power or central system member, whether there was outside intervention and, if so, whether the intervening state was a major power, on what side they intervened, who won the war, number of battle deaths, total population, and total number of pre-war armed forces.},

	abstract = {The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) native to South America is a noxious invasive species in many parts of the world. The venom secreted from the S. invicta stinger is a potent topical insecticide and it is fatal to other ants. In the southern USA, however, this ant species is often displaced by Rasberry crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva), another invader from South America. The recent antidote hypothesis does not fully explain why N. fulva displaces S. invicta. Is there a winning offensive strategy that N. fulva uses to fight against S. invicta? To better understand the relationships between two species, we investigated the responses of both N. fulva and S. invicta to their major secondary metabolites alone or combination in comparison with no treatment or water. First, we examined the impacts of topical application of alkaloids extracted from S. invicta gasters (venom) and formic acid on S. invicta including the treatments by alkaloids, formic acid, mixtures of both, and formic acid following alkaloids. Second, we examined the impacts of topical application of fresh fluid dispersed from S. invicta gasters (venom) and formic acid on N. fulva including the treatments by venom, formic acid, formic acid following venom, and water following venom. Third, we examined the impacts of topical application of alkaloids extracted from S. invicta and formic acid on N. fulva including the treatments by alkaloids, formic acid, mixtures of both, and formic acid following alkaloids. Then, we studied the response of S. invicta to the separate or combined application of formic acid, 2-tridecanone, and n-undecane, three known metabolites produced by N. fulva. We finally conducted the conflict experiments of the two species to observe the behavior of each during the process. We found that S. invicta and N. fulva can use alkaloids and formic acid, respectively, to kill their competitors. However, these weapons are costly to the producers because they are also fatal to themselves when externally applied. Application of the S. invicta venom or alkaloids can kill both ant species and following uses of formic acid enhanced the mortality. This indicates that formic acid does not detoxify the S. invicta venom or alkaloids. Our earlier investigation found that the S. invicta workers with gaster injury demonstrated higher mortality than the uninjured ants. Therefore, our findings suggest that N. fulva can displace the S. invicta is largely because they have enormous populations and can use formic acid as offensive weapons to kill S. invicta.},

The venom elicits a ‘mass attack’ response in other major workers. Formic acid and n-undecane presented together experimentally also evoke this response, the mixture being considerably more effective than either compound tested separately. These compounds act in combination with the mandibular gland secretions to form a complex alarm/defence system.},

In many regions, people use weaver ants for food, medicine, and/or as biological control agents. There are two recog- nized species of weaver ants: Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille, 1802) in Africa and Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius, 1775) in Asia, Australia, and the West- ern Pacific. Here, I mapped the geographic distribution of O. smaragdina based on {\textgreater}2700 site records from 21 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bru- nei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, and Vietnam. The vast majority of O. smarag- dina records come from areas with Tropical (Group A) climates according to the Köppen-Geiger system: rainforest (Af), monsoon (Am), and savanna (Aw). However, {\textgreater}250 records come from areas classified on the map as having a Sub- tropical (Group C) climates, mostly in the Himalayan foothills of India and Ne- pal, southern China, northern Vietnam, and the southern coast of Queensland, Australia. Almost all these sites are classified as dry winter subtropical climate (Cwa). A few O. smaragdina sites are classified as having Arid (Group B) cli- mates, all from warm semi-arid (BSh) areas. This range map based on site re- cords corrects inaccuracies in earlier published range maps.},
