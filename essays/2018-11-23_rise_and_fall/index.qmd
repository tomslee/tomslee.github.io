Introduction
============

It is now ten years since some of the best known Sharing Economy
companies were founded, and about six years since the name "Sharing
Economy" became used to identify this wave of internet companies. In
that time we have seen claims that this is a new model of employment,
even that it is the future of work, and that it is fundamentally
changing the cities in which we live. But in recent years we've also
seen signs of a bubble. A few years ago the story of the Sharing Economy
would have been simple: here is a new model, and some people like it and
some do not, but it works. Now there is more scepticism, and the phrase
itself may be fading from public discourse.

This essay gives a quick tour of the sharing economy, from its
beginnings after the 2008 financial crash to today. I will walk through
some of the business models and some of the economics of this sector,
and sketch some of the controversies. There is another theme to the
essay, which is "who makes the future?" Is the world of work, for
example, built by technology companies in Silicon Valley, or can the
rest of the world have a say as well.

2008: Beginnings
================

Let's look at three companies which each started just about ten years
ago and which had a similar business model in common, even though the
people involved did not know each other at all. There was no name for it
at the time, but there was something in the air...

Let's start with Airbnb, which you will probably know is the
controversial short-term rental or holiday accommodation company, where
people rent out residential homes for use by tourists and other
visitors.

In 2007, newly graduated design students Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia
were looking for ways to make their end-of-month rental payments in San
Francisco when an industry conference came to town. They bought some
inflatable airbeds and offered accommodations to attendees looking for a
cheap place to stay. They were inundated with requests and realized
there may be a market for this kind of thing, and so "Airbed &
Breakfast" was born. [^1]

Since then, the story has been one of hard work and growth. Running up
the limit on multiple credit cards to finance the very beginnings, they
got an early investment from Paul Graham's *Y-Combinator* fund.
Struggling to get the site to take off, they went out to their biggest
city (New York) and got the hosts to have professional photos taken of
their rooms to make them more appealing; the bookings increased, and
professional photography continues to be the most effective way for a
host to attract guests. Other maneuvers included a breakfast-cereal
pitch around the Democratic convention in Chicago and a widely
criticized email campaign via Craigslist.

After the early tribulations, the now-trio of Chesky, Gebbia, and Nathan
Blecharczyk found themselves at the head of a phenomenon. In 2011 Airbnb
had 50,000 listings; in 2012 that number more than doubled to 120,000;
by the end of 2013 it was 550,000; in 2018 it is nearly 5 million
listings. [^2] For comparison, the largest hotel company in the world by
number of rooms is the InterContinental Group with 775,000 rooms. [^3]

Just as Airbnb was getting started, two entrepreneurs were attending a
conference in Paris, and had a hard time finding a cab. These two were
Travis Kalanick, who was to go on to be the controversial CEO of Uber,
and Garrett Camp. They didn't need to worry about paying rent, as both
were already rich from earlier technology ventures. Wouldn't it be
great, they thought, if you could get a cab just by pressing a button on
the newly released iPhone.

In its early days, Uber worked with limo companies to provide drivers,
but then they realized that a competitor named Lyft was using amateur
drivers rather than professionals, and Uber did not want to be left out.
So they set up Uber X, which is Uber Pop in most of Europe, and opened
up their business to independent drivers.

Uber's growth has been even more dramatic than that of Airbnb. The
company has raised investment money like no other, raising tens of
billions of dollars in investment.

Our third example is less well known now, but it was often talked about
as another archetype of the Sharing Economy. Here is how the company's
web site described the founding story.

It was a cold night in Boston in February of 2008 when Leah Busque
realized she was out of dog food for her 100-lb yellow lab, Kobe. Leah
thought to herself, "Wouldn't it be nice if there was a place online I
could go to connect with my neighbors---maybe one who was already at the
store at that very moment---who could help me out?"

From this experience, TaskRabbit (formerly RUNmyERRAND), an online and
mobile marketplace that connects neighbors to get things done, was born
. . . Neighbors helping neighbors---it's an old school concept
reimagined for today. [^4]

One of the typical tasks that people helped with was assembling Ikea
furniture. TaskRabbit had early successes and attracted a lot of
attention, but in the end it did not become the kind of global company
that Airbnb and Uber have become. Instead, after several years as an
independent company, it sold itself to Ikea.

Most people's problems don't turn into multi-billion dollar companies.
Timing \-\-- whether by luck or by skill -- was essential to their
success. Here is a set of things that had been put in place in the few
years before 2008, each of which was needed for Airbnb and Uber to take
off:

-   Broad-band internet. Many homes had computers, and many people were
    increasingly comfortable with the Internet as a part of their daily
    lives.

-   Online payments. People were also getting used to using credit cards
    on the Internet to pay for their purchases at Amazon, eBay, Expedia
    and other early successes.

-   Mobile computing. Beyond that, we were entering the era of the
    smartphone. The iPhone was released in 2007 and Uber, for one, could
    not have been invented before the iPhone.

-   Social media. In the early years, pseudonyms and anonymity were the
    norm on the Internet. As the famous cartoon caption went: "On the
    Internet, nobody knows you're a dog". But starting with Facebook in
    2006, many people were getting used to the idea of using real names.
    TaskRabbit and Uber's competitor Lyft both hooked into Facebook's
    user identification system as a part of their business model, and
    Airbnb and others used Facebook accounts as proof of identity.

-   Rating systems. The use of ratings, particularly for Netflix movies
    and Amazon books, but also through sites such as Yelp and
    Travelocity, had spread and the five-star rating that is now
    ubiquitous was becoming common.

-   Cloud computing. Starting in 2006 Amazon started renting out
    computer usage from its own massive data centres at bargain prices,
    starting the era of cloud computing. This meant that new companies
    could start up without buying expensive hardware: they could use
    Amazon for their computing needs and get started much more cheaply.

-   Crowdsourcing. The basic computing architecture of the Sharing
    Economy is the "platform" where the company itself runs the
    software, but those who provide the content come from outside. The
    success of Wikipedia showed this could be done, and eBay showed you
    could build a valuable company that way. YouTube was and continues
    to be a remarkable example of this crowdsourced structure.

Even though these were all present, the Sharing Economy brought with it
the shock of the new \-\-- pressing a button on your phone and seeing a
car appear seemed like magic, and booking to stay in somebody's house
half way around the world opened up new possibilities for travel. The
novelty of the experiences gave the new services an aura of cool, and
many people immediately thought: this is the future.

2010 -- 2015: Rise
==================

Airbnb and Uber were not founded as Sharing Economy companies, because
the name did not exist. In the years 2010 to 2012 a set of other
companies were founded using a similar business model and commentators
looked for names to describe this trend. "Collaborative economy"^1^,
"circular economy", [^5] and "the mesh"[^6] were all put forward, but in
the end the Sharing Economy won.

If there is a one-sentence description of the Sharing Economy, it may be
*Internet platforms for real-world services*. The first few years of the
century had seen internet platforms for retail (Amazon and eBay), for
social media exchanges and advertising (Google and Facebook), and for
media (Netflix, Apple, YouTube). Of particular interest were eBay and
YouTube: crowdsourced platforms where the content seemed to appear by
magic. The Sharing Economy takes this model, but instead of uploading
videos the platform is used for people who provide real-world services.

How far can crowdsourced Internet platforms go? Can their economic
benefits be applied to the service economy too? That's what the Sharing
Economy phenomenon asks us.

A 2017 report for the World Economic Forum gives a three-point
definition.[^7] First is "The use of digital technologies to match
buyers and sellers," which is similar to the point above. But they add
two other components. One is "Capitalizing on idle capacity": the
service providers are generally offering something they already own, but
which they are not using right now. So the service providers are not
employees of the platform owners, they are independent actors who are
making use of their own assets. To go back to our three stories: perhaps
they have a car, and can drive for Uber; perhaps they have some spare
time and can run some errands for TaskRabbit; perhaps they have a spare
room and can put it on Airbnb. The other additional point is "trust
verification", to which I'll return.

With this framework, let's look at some examples of companies that
started up in those years of 2010 to 2012. This was the era when
seemingly a million start-up plans were pitched as the "Uber for this"
or the "Airbnb for that". But I want to start with something that is the
opposite. The Toronto Tool Library[^8] is a non-profit organization that
lets people rent tools for home projects. The organization is
geographically limited and community focused: it has no plans to drive
major stores out of business or to become a global behemoth. But it
matters to the story of the Sharing Economy because it draws on one of
the early images that promoted the idea, which is the story of the power
drill.[^9] Many of us have a hand drill that sits on a shelf and is
hardly ever used and Rachel Botsman, who was one of the early promoters
of the Sharing Economy and helped to articulate it as a new development,
says: we don't really want a drill, what we want is the hole it makes.
So why not share a drill instead of owning it? Sharing is sustainable,
it helps us get off the consumerist track of ownership, weighed down by
our goods. The drill was the embodiment of using "idle capacity". It has
an appealing sustainability angle to it and also hints to a concept
called "access over ownership": we don't have to buy in to the bourgeois
and consumerist culture of ownership, we can tread more lightly on the
earth by dipping in and out of these sharing arrangements instead. It
was a catchy and attractive image.

In 2013 Airbnb was already taking off, and a natural extension of that
idea was to share meals. Airbnb said "you don't need hotels, you just
need a platform where you can connect with other people." Cookening,
Feastly and other sites applied the same logic to restaurants. If you
are travelling to a new city, why not eat like a local in their own
house? Again, the appeal here is to authenticity, to personal connection
rather than institutions and companies, and to the unusual combination
of small and big that crowdsourcing requires: many small individual
exchanges building a global platform.

Tools and meals are fairly low risk, banged thumbs and food poisoning
aside, but finance is surely something different. Remember that we are
talking about a period right after the financial crisis, when personal
finances were stretched and banks were viewed with suspicion. So
companies like Lending Club took a lead from charities such as Kiva,
which focused on direct person-to-person donations, as well as from
initiatives like the Grameen bank, which used social lending to pioneer
the idea of microfinance, and whose founder Mohammed Yunus won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 2006. The idea behind peer-to-peer lending was that
individuals could lend to each other, combining social purpose and sound
investment.

Here the question of trust is at its most severe. What happens if I take
a loan from you and don't pay it back? How do you assess credit? The
early players in this industry like Lending Club and Prosper were
experimenting with a variety of approaches, and we'll see how that
worked out later on.

And to finish, let's go back to household services like TaskRabbit. A
lot of companies started in this area. One is Homejoy, which was
Google's venture into housecleaning -- an eyebrow-raising idea in
itself. Another was Handy, which looked to broaden from cleaning to
other services like plumbing and carpentry.

And there were lots of others. A short list would include DogVacay,
which was often written about to show the quirky and personal aspect of
the market. Instacart and Deliveroo highlighted the food delivery area,
which is still going strong. BlaBlaCar is a French service for taking
rides from city to city. ZipCar was important as one of the first
carsharing companies, and it preceded most of the others here.

In 2013 to 2015 various lists of Sharing Economy companies were
published, and they often had hundreds of examples. But for some
analysts, this was just the beginning. PwC is one of the most
consistently upbeat forecasting agencies around the Sharing Economy, and
have forecast markets sizes well into the hundreds of billions of
dollars in a few years time. It looks like the Sharing Economy is taking
off.

With those specific examples in mind, let's take one more look at a
definition.

First, we have the platform, and that's the Sharing Economy company.
Perhaps it is Homejoy, or DogVacay, or Lending Club. It matches service
providers to consumers. It doesn't take on providing the service itself,
but it does handle payments, identity verification, and ratings. Rating
systems were often called out as one of the main innovations of the
Sharing Economy. *New York Times* columnist Thomas Friedman lauds
"Airbnb's real innovation---a platform of 'trust'---where everyone could
not only see everyone else's identity but also rate them as good, bad or
indifferent hosts or guests. This meant everyone using the system would
pretty quickly develop a relevant 'reputation' visible to everyone else
in the system." [^10] Friedman was writing just a couple of weeks after
his *New York Times* stablemate David Brooks described "*How Airbnb and
Lyft Finally Got Americans to Trust Each Other*": "Companies like Airbnb
establish trust through ratings mechanisms . . . People in the Airbnb
economy don't have the option of trusting each other on the basis of
institutional affiliations, so they do it on the basis of online
signaling and peer evaluations." [^11]

On the consumer side we have seen that the Sharing Economy fits into and
help to shape a trend of particularly young people as valuing
experiences over ownership, and choosing access over ownership. Your
books and music may already be on devices: why buy a car when you can
take an Uber? Everything you need is on your phone or your computer.

And then there are the service providers, who are presented as partners
rather than employees. The word that used early on was
"micro-entrepreneurs": not really companies, not really private
individuals, but somewhere in between. And by making the most of their
unused assets they were being green, building community, and making a
little money.

Business models and strategy
============================

Not all sharing economy business models are novel, or successful, but
when it comes to strategy there are some distinctive features for this
sector.

The appeal of platforms to investors lies in the idea of increasing
returns to scale. There is a popular phrase that you may have seen. The
biggest hotel company \-- Airbnb \-- owns no property. The biggest taxi
company \-- Uber \-- owns no cars. This mimics the way that Facebook and
YouTube own no content. Each is as big as the biggest company in their
market. The value, it seems, is in the platform.

One of the benefits of this model is that if a company sees demand, it
can grow very quickly and globally. Just as other Internet companies
have spread around the world, so can Airbnb and Uber. If a hotel chain
wants to add another 100 rooms it has to build a hotel, but for Airbnb
it's just another row in a database. So on the supply side there are
benefits here, sometimes labelled as a "zero marginal cost" business
structure.

There are increasing returns on the demand side as well as on the supply
side, and they go under the name network effects. Renters want to be
where travellers are, and travellers want to be where renters are. So
just like social media, every person who takes a trip on Airbnb, and
every person who adds a listing, makes it more attractive for everyone
else.

One of the things about increasing returns to scale is that it makes it
difficult for new companies to enter the market: it favours a natural
monopoly, or at least oligopoly. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix have few real
competitors. And this industrial organization makes profits possible.

Zero marginal costs and network effects: put the two together and you
can see why investors are enthusiastic. Can Airbnb and Uber do for
services what Amazon has done for retail, what Wikipedia did for the
encyclopedia, and Apple and Spotify have done for music? Is the market
in these services a winner-take-all? The large scale of venture capital
investment shows that a lot of people are prepared to bet that it is.

There is a real pressure among startups to grow quickly, and one of the
strategies that gained prominence early was a piece of advice given to
Airbnb by their early investor Y Combinator: do things that don't scale.
[^12]

When a company starts, it doesn't have the benefit of network effects so
it can't rely on them. Instead it needs something different to set
itself apart and get growth started. For Airbnb that was visiting hosts
in its first significant market, and helping them present their listings
in an attractive way on the site. Paying for a photographer was a big
step forward: it made a big difference to those early listings and got
the idea of homesharing started.

But of course in business everyone wants a winning formula, and applying
it blindly is rarely successful. Another Sharing Economy company,
Washio, set out to do the same as Airbnb but for laundry: the company
was going to "demolish laundry". [^13] They gave each customer cookies,
and packaged the laundry with sleek black bags. But it turned out that
the ideas of the Sharing Economy don't really work for laundry. To start
with the cost side: most of the cost is involved in actually doing the
laundry and digital technology doesn't help with that. On the demand
side: just because other people are doing their laundry through Washio
doesn't make a big difference to me, so network effects were limited.
And because of that, the strategy was just losing money on every sale.
Washio ceased operations in 2016.

There is another aspect of business strategy that was central to the
growth of the Sharing Economy. I've touched on it a couple of times.
Many of these companies did not just see themselves as businesses, they
were also a movement: brands with a purpose.

The companies fostered a community of so-called micro-entrepreneurs and
leaned heavily on ideas of democratization. Instead of relying on
faceless corporations we can now provide services to each other, in a
"peer to peer" fashion. You don't need a bank to get a loan, you don't
need a hotel to take a holiday, you don't need a taxi to get across
town, you just go to the Internet and click or tap. The idea appeals to
those already invested in new technologies: the old rules don't apply,
we have a better way now. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said that most of the
reasons for regulation in the accommodation and transport spaces were
consumer protection, and reputation systems could carry out that task
better than cities. [^14]

So the Sharing Economy shared a moment with the growth of Wikipedia,
with the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and the idea of Facebook
revolutions and social media as a democratizing force in politics. The
internet was no longer this place you went to when you sat at a desk, it
was moving into the real world, and taking its values with it.

But from the beginning there were tensions built into the Sharing
Economy, and the name captures the problem. Is this about a community or
a business?

On the one hand it's about sharing: it's social, it's community-focused,
and personal. On the other hand, it's an economy: it's about market
transactions and prices, where scale is the key to profit and perhaps to
monopoly rents.

The tensions were captured in an organization set up in 2013 called
Peers. It called itself a grassroots movement set up to clear out
old-fashioned regulations and clear a path for the new sharing economy
companies. But it was founded by Airbnb, whose goal was to make money.

In the same way, the companies were touted as democratizing, but were
set up with the goal of making money for investors, including some of
the richest people on the planet.

It's an attitude that has been called the Californian Ideology, [^15]
which is that you can have both. You can be rebellious,
anti-establishment, and against hierarchy; but you can also make a big
pile of money while doing it. You can be ethical, and live a life of
purpose, and you can be rich beyond your wildest dreams.

But some early examples showed that you cannot have everything, and when
it comes to choosing between community and profit, commercial
enterprises will choose profit.

Fall?
=====

I hope that gives an idea of the ideas behind the Sharing Economy. It's
been ten years now, and there has been a perhaps-inevitable shakeout.

For many of the "Uber for X" companies, like Washio, the promise of new
efficiencies has proved hard to achieve. The unpleasant surprise was
perhaps told best by Sarah Kessler, who went back to look at the story
of the drill. [^16] She showed that many of those companies who were
looking to follow the Sharing Economy template were not growing fast.
Going across town to get a drill from someone you don't know when you
can buy one for \$50 was too much of a problem.

We have already seen that Washio went bust because its business model
did not reflect reality. Laundry, it turns out, is laundry. In the same
way, the cleaning company Homejoy was set up with \$30 million from
Google Ventures, but any efficiency it gained came at the cost of its
cleaners, who were reported in one revealing article as living under
bridges. [^17] The cost of cleaning is what you pay the cleaners. The
Internet only helps with that if you can push costs, like the time to
travel, onto the cleaners. And obviously they did not want to bear that
cost, so Homejoy had a hard time keeping staff.

Adding to the problem is that once a homeowner has found a good cleaner,
they probably want the same one again, so the matching problem is not a
huge benefit, and if the cleaner is really a micro-entrepreneur, then
the homeowner can just make a deal with them directly and cut out
Homejoy's portion of the cost. Homejoy went out of business a few years
to.

Other companies had to carry out what technology companies call a
"pivot": change their business model to something different. TaskRabbit
has sold itself to Ikea, and Instacart has partnered with grocery
chains, so both are now a source of cheap labour for orthodox businesses
rather than a peer-to-peer alternative. Perhaps the biggest pivot was in
the "peer-to-peer lending" market. The companies struggled with high
rates of default, and ended up changing the name to what they call
"marketplace lending". Most of the loans for these companies now come
from regular financial institutions, rather than individuals. The role
of the platforms has changed to be that of an automated loan officer:
algorithmically assessing the credit-worthiness of applicants, and
supplying those assessments to the financial institutions who can decide
whether or not to make the loan.

What does this tell us? For many companies, the Internet has not been
the game changer they thought. For others, the Internet has worked, but
they have had to move from the Sharing Economy model. And that leaves us
focusing again on the survivors.

2018: Full circle?
==================

In 2018 it seems like we are nearly back to where we started: left with
two successful industries-- ridesharing and short-term rentals. There is
Airbnb and there is Uber.

But while the overall phenomenon of the Sharing Economy may be fading,
these two are still growing rapidly. A look at their success is still
valuable because of their size and impact, and also because some of the
aspects of their business is a first look at the next wave of
innovation, in which the service providers themselves are algorithms
instead of people. The world of autonomous vehicles and AI services will
be platform-based businesses that face many of the same challenges as
the Sharing Economy.

It seems like Airbnb and Uber are two cases where the Sharing Economy
model worked: zero marginal costs and network effects combining to give
runaway success. But for Uber at least, it may be too early to say that.

Uber is often described as a company like Amazon, or Google, or Apple:
one that has changed the nature of the world in which we live. It is
easy to forget that Uber is still not a profitable company, and as
financial quarter after quarter goes by with large losses (over \$1
Billion in 2018 Q3 [^18]), it is becoming increasingly doubtful whether
its business model is sustainable. [^19]

Uber's challenge is to keep both drivers and riders happy. If it raises
prices it loses riders and if it keeps them low then driver retention
becomes a challenge. Much of the early enthusiasm for the company
assumed that this balancing act was solvable because of the huge
efficiency increases that Uber was bringing to the industry, helping
riders and drivers find each other and eliminating idle time for
drivers. The enthusiasm peaked with a 2014 report in the Washington Post
suggesting that some Uber drivers were earning \$90,000 a year, [^20]
but that story quickly vanished and now the stories are far more often
about drivers earning less than minimum wage, or facing financial
difficulties because they are unable to keep up payments on a leased
car. [^21]

So far Uber has solved its problem by throwing money at it. Uber
subsidises rides by providing enticements to the drivers, burning
through billions of dollars of capital while looking with increasing
desperation for a profitable business model.

Recent reports from New York City suggest that Uber and Lyft cars are
empty for at least as much of the time as the traditional "yellow
cabs".[^22] This is not the case everywhere, but it suggests that
efficiency in its current market is not likely to drive profitability.
Maybe squeezing more out of drivers will be a way to do it? Uber is
investing in dynamic pricing, driver incentives, and a myriad of other
techniques for taking more out of every rider's dollar [^23], but we
should not be too quick to assume they will succeed. It remains possible
that Uber is a blip.

Meanwhile, Airbnb is profitable, but that is a low bar to reach for a
company valued at \$31 Billion, whose repeated attempts to break into
"whole trip" planning and business travel have been unsuccessful.

Still, both these companies have shown that rapid and global growth is
possible. They have done so at the cost of continual controversy in
cities around the world where they have become popular. There are many
different controversies, but many have a common origin. We highlighted
the need for Sharing Economy companies to have a "zero marginal cost"
model, but that model relies on the company itself not having
significant new expenses for each service provider or each transaction.
And it has become clear that "zero marginal cost" is not a feature of
the technology alone, it also depends on the laws that govern the
company's actions.

Sharing Economy companies present themselves in their terms and
conditions as a marketplace. Uber's user agreement, for example, says
"Your ability to obtain transportation... through the use of The
Services does not establish Uber as a provider of transportation,
logistics or delivery services or as a transportation carrier". The
assertion is that the exchange itself, and anything that may go wrong
with it, is between the consumer and the service provider, not the
consumer and Uber. Other sharing economy companies present themselves in
the same way. Financially, this gets them off the hook for liability and
other problems, and they have relied on a particular American law to
sustain this position. Section 230 of the "Communications Decency Act"
includes this phrase:

> No provider... of an interactive computer service shall be treated as
> the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
> information content provider.

These sentences were written with web sites like YouTube in mind. The
hosting platform itself was protected from liability for the actions of
the users on the site. If someone uploads illegal videos to YouTube,
YouTube is at least partially protected from responsibility.

Whether Section 230 to the Sharing Economy is still in dispute. The
European Court of Justice recently ruled that Uber may not qualify for
this kind of protection:

> The service provided by Uber is more than an intermediation service...
> The ride-booking company must be classified as 'a service in the field
> of transport.' [^24]

In 2016 a London tribunal judge was even more direct:

> The notion thatÂ UberÂ in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses
> linked by a common 'platform' is to our minds faintly ridiculous.
> [^25]

The end result will not be a simple outcome, as it depends on laws in
different jurisdictions and will vary from company to company. But the
impacts are huge: all kinds of disputes surrounding these companies
focus on their responsibility for some aspects of their business that
they are trying to avoid. Here is a brief list:

-   Are Uber drivers employees? Their flexibility suggests not, but that
    is not the only criterion for employment: many jurisdictions also
    weigh independence while on the job as a criterion, and Uber drivers
    do not set their own prices, do not get to select riders, and have
    many small controls over how they do their job. Many would say that
    full-time Uber drivers, which is a large part of the overall
    business, should qualify for many of the benefits that employees
    get. This would add significantly to Uber's costs, and present them
    with even more financial problems. [^26]

-   In the same way, Airbnb maintains that it is not responsible if its
    hosts break the law or break their tenancy agreements in offering
    their space for rent, but the company also makes it very difficult
    for cities to go after hosts because Airbnb does not, in general,
    share host information with the cities where it operates. [^27]
    Again, the outcome of this dispute will have a real effect on
    Airbnb's cost structure.

-   While Brian Chesky was confident that his rating systems could solve
    consumer protection problems, it has turned out that there are many
    that ratings cannot address. [^28] Whether it is providing a usable
    complaint system, ensuring vehicle safety, ensuring the safety of
    Airbnb apartments, so far the Sharing Economy companies have avoided
    many of the costs that other providers of commercial services have
    to undertake. To the extent that they have to take on the cost of
    things going wrong for consumers, the zero-marginal cost model will
    vanish.

-   As all the transactions on the platform go through the Internet,
    both companies have set up shell structures so that they are routed
    through subsidiaries in tax-friendly jurisdictions. [^29] By not
    paying into the tax base of the cities where they operate, the
    companies are essentially parasitic on cities.

-   There are also many aspects of running cities that governments care
    about, from road congestion to housing affordability, where there
    have been continual disputes about the responsibility of the
    platform companies. Airbnb has long promoted a vision of openness
    and authenticity, promising that you could "live like a local", but
    in some of their biggest markets the locals have not been so happy
    about it: Paris neighbourhoods have been losing population,
    Barcelona has said "bring refugees, keep out tourists". Managing
    tourism effectively is a matter of balance, and cities are becoming
    increasingly assertive in their dealings with Airbnb.

The lesson from all these disputes is that the business model of new
technology companies is not dictated solely by the technology itself, it
also reflects the responsibilities we expect companies -- particularly
large global companies -- to accept in order to operate.

It has been interesting to watch cities become more assertive over time.
When Airbnb and Uber appeared on the scene full of brash promises, they
were intimidated by the challenge to get on board with the future or be
left behind, especially when the platforms could mobilize thousands of
happy customers and service providers to lobby on their behalf. But now
cities are realizing that some problems are shared, and that they have
choices beyond "take it or leave it". Major tourist cities are now
regularly talking to each other about their successes and failures when
dealing with Airbnb, for example, and out of this is growing a new set
of rules that balance the interests of tourists with those of the
citizens in the places they visit.

If the "zero marginal cost" model is shaped by laws as much as by
technology, it raises the question of who builds the future? The debates
around the Sharing Economy mirror earlier debates that have grown around
technological innovation, from the industrial revolution on. Changes are
one part technological, and one part social, and getting the social
arrangements right is just as important for a healthy future as getting
the technology right. Those in the 19^th^ century who fought for child
labour protections or the forty hour working week or the vote were just
as much a part of building the future as the new industrialists and
inventors.

It's the same today. Technology will be a part of the changes that shape
the lives of our children, but so too will the legal and social changes
that surround them. So an understanding of history, of economics, of
society and what a good society needs is just as important as developing
a new twist on an artificial intelligence algorithm when it comes to
shaping the future. Educators in particular play an important role in
ensuring the next generation has the critical faculties and
understanding of society that is going to be needed to ensure they have
a healthy planet and a healthy relationship with our computational
future.

The future of transport and travel is not being made only by the
technology companies, it is being made in city government offices around
the world. It will be made not just by today's computer science
students, but by our economics students and business students as well.
