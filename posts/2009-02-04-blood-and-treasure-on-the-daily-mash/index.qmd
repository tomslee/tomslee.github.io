The wonderful [Blood and Treasure](http://bloodandtreasure.typepad.com/blood_treasure/2009/02/british-onion-derivative-pretty-good-despite-that-says-area-man.html) on the Onion-derivative Daily Mash:

similarities to make an Onionesque publication work on this side of the
Atlantic.
“There’s the same toxic mix of corporate dominance, authoritarian
government and witless media, all marinated in a deep well of
comprehensive public stupidity.
