I'd just like to say that Mark Steyn's article [The war on terror is the real women's issue](http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20060109_118922_118922) in Maclean's is the worst piece of crap I've read in a long time. I think every single line has something wrong with it - a gratuitous insult, a twisted argument, a non sequitur, or just something plain stupid. 




I guess it's one way to get attention, but it is adolescent through and through.




Thanks to [This Mag](http://blog.thismagazine.ca/archives/2006/01/the_cooptingor.html) for raising my blood pressure.
