What's up with google? This morning I google "twitter time magazine" to look for an article, and every item on the search results, including time.com, has a "This site may harm your computer" label. See here:

[![Mayharm](http://whimsley.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451d3b369e20111683745e8970c-320wi)](http://whimsley.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451d3b369e20111683745e8970c-popup)
  


As a result, I can't actually get to any of the sites on the list. And any search I do give the same result. The BBC, Wikipedia, you name it. And clicking through to the "Safe browsing diagnostic page" for the site just gives "Server Error".

  


The effect is that google, in this house, is basically offline. And for all I have mixed feelings about google, that's not nice. I may have to do something useful.

  


Is this just google.ca? Is it just me? Or what?   


  


Update: [It was Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-site-may-harm-your-computer-on.html). One little / and the world goes to pot.
