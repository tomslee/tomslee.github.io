The challenge:

Find a blog with a URL of the form firstname.blogspot.com that is either (a) not taken, or (b) still active.  


  


The rules:

  


I am sole arbiter of what qualifies as a firstname.

  


The prize:

  


Fame, no fortune.[1]

  


Here are some that are dead. It is kind of fun[2] - if you are really bored - to look at the content of these blogs. There is something melancholy about so many abandoned sites. So much tumbleweed. Lists of tumbleweed blogs would be appreciated too.

[1] I have actually found a blog of this form, so you lose and I win. Still it's kind of interesting[3] how many fail the test and it does make you wonder about all those counts of the number of bloggers in the world.  [http://tina.blogspot.com/](http://tina.blogspot.com/)  


  


[2] OK, it's not actually fun.  


  


[3] OK, it's not actually interesting either.
