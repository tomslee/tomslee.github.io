That's my book's [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/No-one-Makes-You-Shop-Wal-Mart/dp/189707106X) number right now.




It's the lowest (best) I've seen it in the year since publication, which is pretty encouraging. Usually it's up in the 100,000 to 500,000 range, but a series of about three purchases this week knocked it down.




Yes, I still check it far too much.
