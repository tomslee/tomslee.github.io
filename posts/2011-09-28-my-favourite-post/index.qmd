... is [this one](../2009-11-14-the-pirates-dilemma-by-matt-mason-a-review/).


Every now and then I look back at previous posts on this blog. Some I still like, some not so much.  Some got a lot of views at one time or another, but my favourite post of all got little attention.

I think that this time right now, with Amazon's and Facebook's recent announcements and Apple's to come next month, mark a turning point in attitudes to the web and the companies that dominate it.




So please, I don't often trumpet my own writing and it's not that easy to read, but [this post](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2009/11/pirates-dilemma-review-remixed.html) is exactly what this blog is all about.
