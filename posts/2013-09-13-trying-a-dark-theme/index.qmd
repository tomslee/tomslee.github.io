				I'm a chronic theme-fiddler, and I thought I'd try to use a version of the [zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/)Â colour theme that I use in emacs and vim. It's designed to be low-contrast, and easy on the eyes for extended use. Zenburn works well for me in Org mode (see [here](http://orgmode.org/worg/color-themes-screenshot.html)), so I thought I'd give it a go. If light-on-dark bothers you, or anything else come to that, let me know in the comments.

The Wordpress theme is [Parabola](http://www.cryoutcreations.eu/parabola) from cryout, which is fantastically customizable. The colour choices from the zenburn palette are my own.
