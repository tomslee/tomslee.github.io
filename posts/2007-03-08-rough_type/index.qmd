You know who writes well about technology and internet technology in particular? [Nicholas G. Carr](http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/), that's who.




His blog is called [Rough Type](http://www.roughtype.com). Sample posts are:




Today's on [Customer Value and the Network Effect](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/the_value_of_ne.php)




From a few days ago, [Wikipedia's Credentialism Crisis](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/wikipedias_cred.php).




From several months ago, social networking and TS Eliot in [The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock's Avatar](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/05/the_love_song_o_1.php).




From a year ago, [The Editor on the Crowd](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/03/the_editor_and.php), which is about filtering - the subject of Chapter 7 of The Long Tail and my next chapter to write about here.
