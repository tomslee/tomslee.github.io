I found out this evening that Google Earth has a [data update](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/219154/an/latest/page/0#219154) that covers many cities in the UK. Well, that was my evening wasted. You can now see the whole area where I grew up in detail, right down to the car in my Mum's driveway (of a couple of years ago). Very addictive.
