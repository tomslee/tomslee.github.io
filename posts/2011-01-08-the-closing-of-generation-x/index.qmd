    with the beat of Hiawatha.</em></span>

    <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On December twenty-eighth I
    <a href="http://genxvideo.blogspot.com/2010/12/fin-de-siecle.html" target="_self">heard</a> that <a href="http://genxvideo.com" target="_self">Generation X</a> will
    close its doors and that, beginning
    New Year's Day they would be selling
    off their films. The old and mainstream,
    horror and alternative and
    more will go until the doors are
    shut for good on Valen-tine's Day.
    Rental shops are on the way out,
    but this exit has been met with
    <a href="http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/2011/jan/7/news/generation-x-close-february" target="_self">disappointment</a> and <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/307108--changing-video-market-leads-genx-to-close-its-doors" target="_self">dismay</a> that
    is surprising for a small and
    local video store. Which
    makes me think I do not get the
    way that culture works. So maybe
    you can help me out perhaps?
    +     +    +
    When I read of culture and its
    changes, mostly I am reading
    algo-rithmic-ally based thoughts
    written by the digerati,
    based on abstract concepts such as
    filters, networks, and gate-keepers.
    Coasian transaction costs and
    read/write culture fill the pages.
    Yet these concepts miss the very
    things that Generation X brought
    to the town of Waterloo for
    sixteen years of offbeat culture.
    If you read the digerati
    you will read of publishers and
    outlets (video and book and
    music too) as "gatekeepers" whose
    job it is to filter out the
    works that do not make the grade to
    be considered part of "culture".
    Internet-based artists have no
    need for such an institution;
    middle-men will fade away as
    now the artists reach directly
    to their global audiences.
    Well, good luck with that if you have
    neither name nor luck to help you.
    Yes it's true that clouds can store all
    yours and mine and everyone's art,
    yet with no one who curates it
    it will sit upon its disk drive,
    left unnoticed by the public.
    Democratized? I do not think so.
    +     +    +
    "Gatekeeper" just does not capture
    what it is that independent
    stores can bring to local landscapes.
    Certainly it does no justice
    to the complex role that Gen-X
    played in Waterloo for years now.
    Movies are the formal product,
    but community is there too.
    When will Netflix organize a
    zombie walk on uptown streets or
    sponsor The TriCity Roller
    Girls (a flat-track roller derby team)?
    When will iTunes hand out dog treats,
    welcome pets into the store, or
    join with next-door coffee shop to
    raise some money for a goat?
    Amazon will never help to
    run a standup festival, or
    carve a space for LGBT
    films (and also TV series).
    Nor will Googlers ever be as
    cool as staff who know their subject,
    finding just the film you mean when
    hazy recollections are the most you
    can recount about some movie.
    Concerts, lectures, workshops, protests
    posted on the notice board, and
    funky buttons at the counter, next to
    "Theme of Week" films (where else would you
    find "The Missing Limb" for that one?)
    And I'm sure there's more I'm missing.
    Film enthusiasts, I know, would
    see it as a place to gather:
    now where will they meet each other?
    +     +    +
    "Gatekeeper" suggests a barrier
    keeping out what wants to come in.
    But the truth is much more friendly;
    "Gard'ner" is a better title
    for the independent stores who
    foster culture in their cities.
    Tending a community of
    artists, readers, watchers, fans is
    more involved than HTML.
    I was speaking to a drummer
    in a local indie band, who told
    me that the music scene still
    has the big stars (they will
    always be here) and that there are
    many smaller acts who find their
    way to play at bars and clubs; but
    what is missing is the middle -
    bands go viral or they wither.
    In the book world it's the same: the
    midlist author is the one who
    finds they can no longer reach a
    public focused on the moment.
    Large fixed costs and network effects
    lend themselves to tournaments where
    winners take all, most take little.
    Better hope you win the sweepstakes!
    It's those modest institutions
    which it's easy to forget, who
    bridge the gap from hobbyist to
    artist, author, movie maker.
    Here's one fact that makes a difference:
    Gen X had a point of view, and
    so do most small institutions.
    Why? Because their owners give a
    damn and that's the thing that matters.
    Algorithms do not capture
    how a healthy culture functions.
    Filters cannot yield the richness
    of the unexpected finding.
    At its heart, community is
    what gives art and culture strength to
    find its feet and make itself heard.
    Platforms for participation
    do not make much diff'rence to that.
    +     +    +
    Many here like me will miss our
    Generation X, but still I
    understand why owner Mike has
    said it's time for him to move on.
    Nothing lasts for ever, does it?
    Let us hope that there are others
    who can take another step and
    start up something new and diff'rent.
    (And at least I'll get more work done!)</span>
