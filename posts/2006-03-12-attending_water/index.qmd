Jeremy Zawodny draws my attention to a technical conference called [Waterfall 2006](http://www.waterfall2006.com/) coming up at the beginning of next month. It tackles the thorny question of software development methodolgies, and should be compulsory for all serious technical people. [Sign up now](http://www.waterfall2006.com/register.html).
