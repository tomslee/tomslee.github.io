While eagerly awaiting Evgeny Morozov's "[The Net Delusion](http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781586488741)" I was reading the two excerpts posted [here](http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/morozovch1.pdf) and [here](http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/morozovch7.pdf). I'm thrilled to be quoted in the second one, and am now more sure than ever that this will be an important book.
