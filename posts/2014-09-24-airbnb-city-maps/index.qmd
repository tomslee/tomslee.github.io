				Inspired by the (much better!) [maps](http://maps.amsterdam.nl/airbnb/?LANG=en) of Amsterdam listings, [here](http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data) are some of my surveys of Airbnb cities converted to Google Fusion Tables. Data is obtained to the best of my ability, and I believe it is statistically pretty good, but I can make no guarantees as to its accuracy. Always visit the actual page for any individual listing.
