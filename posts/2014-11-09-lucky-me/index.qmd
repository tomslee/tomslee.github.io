				Three writerly things I'm enthusiastic about at the moment.

First, my recent post [In Praise of Fake Reviews](http://tomslee.net/2014/10/in-praise-of-fake-reviews.html) has been reworked and polished thanks to the efforts of Rob Horning, and posted at [The New Inquiry](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/in-praise-of-fake-reviews/).

Second, I'm off to New York City next week to take part in the [Digital Labor](http://www.digitallabor.org/) conference. I'll be on a panel on [The Future of Workers in the Sharing Economy](http://www.digitallabor.org/schedule/the-future-of-workers-in-the-sharing-economy); we each talk for about 30 minutes and then discuss. I'll be talking in part about reputation.

Third is an article in progress, but more on that later.
