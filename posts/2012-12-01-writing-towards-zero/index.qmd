Five months have passed since I posted here because I found myself drawn to finishing an earlier project. I thought it would take a couple of weeks but it ended up taking five months. The end result is called "Identity, Institutions, and Uprisings", is available at [SSRN](http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2116471), and over the next few weeks I'm going to provide a more accessible, more political, and less academic version of the project here. I suspect the potential audience is vanishingly small but hey, I'm pleased with it. I'll start tomorrow.
