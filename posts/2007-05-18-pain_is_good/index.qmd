It's been an enjoyable day.




First Alex Tabarrok [threw](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/05/no_one_makes_yo.html) my book against the wall and promised to kick me in the shins if I venture near George Mason University - and sent my Amazon.com ranking up to number 3634.




Now Brad DeLong [offers](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/05/3634.html) to "throw one of my two copies out my sixth-floor office window and to trap
Tom Slee in the Evans Hall middle south elevator for no less than
thirty minutes" - and sends it up to 2,460.




Thanks to both of them. I think.
