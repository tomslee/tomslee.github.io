Thanks to MC for letting me know about this. From Sunday's [Winnipeg Free Press](http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/):

<blockquote>**A different take on consumer power**

> 
> 

> 
> 'WE
make choices every day," writes Ontario author Tom Slee. "We choose the
clothes we wear, the way we travel, the movies we watch, and the places
we shop."
> 
> 

> 
> But even with all this choice, Slee says, the rich are getting richer, while the middle class and poor are losing ground.
> 
> 

> 
> "What has gone wrong?" he asks in this thought-provoking mix of academic and social critique.
> 
> 

> 
> "Why is it that with more choices than any in society in history, we do not get what we want?"
> 
> 

> 
> These basic questions form the underpinnings of this first book by the Waterloo software professional and researcher.
> 
> 

> 
> In
it, Slee explores the pitfalls of a free-market economy; in particular,
what he refers to as "MarketThink," the idea that consumers control the
market, and can hold corporations accountable.
> 
> 

> 
> Slee does his
best to debunk this mindset, arguing that even the most reasonable of
individual decisions can produce negative results for the general
public.
> 
> 

> 
> Much of the book revolves around the fictional foibles of Jack and Jill, who live in the made-up town of Whimsley.
> 
> 

> 
> Slee uses the characters to illustrate the routine conflicts between personal and public gain.
> 
> 

> 
> Should
Jack support a downtown department store, or visit a newly opened
big-box development? And does it really matter if Jill leaves litter in
a public park, when surely others will be more environmentally
conscious?
> 
> 

> 
> No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart also draws on
real-world examples of difficult choices, tackling everything from the
issue of herd mentality to the problem of "free-riders," those who act
in their own best interests while assuming, often mistakenly, that
others will work for the public good.
> 
> 

> 
> Slee's reasoning is
persuasive, and his examples numerous and far-reaching: the contentious
subject of international pollution credits, for one, or the perennial
public vs. private school debate.
> 
> 

> 
> But although No One Makes You
Shop at Wal-Mart is more accessible than the average academic text, it
still falls short of mass-market appeal, and those unfamiliar with game
theory might find some sections slower than others.
> 
> 

> 
> Slee's
pacing is often sluggish, and the overall arrangement of material feels
unfocused. The sheer number of examples to deconstruct is also a little
daunting, an ironic flaw in a book about the dilemmas of choice.
> 
> 

> 
> Slee may have been better off focusing on fewer but more detailed examples to plead his case.
> 
> 

> 
> On
the positive side, Slee's in-text citations are clear and easy to
follow, and readers hoping to learn more about the complexities of
decision-making will come out with a solid list of followup books.
> 
> 

> 
> No
One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart doesn't qualify as light summer reading.
However, the book does offer an intriguing critique of dominant ideas
on consumer power, and puts forward a valid argument for the benefits
of collective decision-making and regulation.
