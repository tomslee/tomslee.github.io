All this time I thought being unable to post frequently was a limitation, but now I find, thanks to the Sunday newspaper, that it is a virtue. In fact, I appear to be part of the slow blogging movement, which is why it took me two days from reading this to posting it.

See the top right of this page, which has stayed that way since before the formation of this movement, for my credibility.

  


I wonder what my aims are? No blogging at all? Maybe someone should start a Silent Blogging movement.  


  


I am no longer a lazy slob. I am now a practitioner of stillness.
