Michael Perelman [points](http://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/2007/01/27/freak-freakonomics/#comment-237) is to "a delightful slam" at Steven Levitt’s hit book _Freakonomics._ by Ariel Rubinstein, who is himself an economist who has done prominent research about bargaining. I enjoyed Freakonomics, but Rubinstein [gives](http://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/freak.pdf) it a very sharp poke with a stick, and he puts his finger on a number of things that I had vaguely disliked about the book, as well as much else. It's a short entertaining read.
