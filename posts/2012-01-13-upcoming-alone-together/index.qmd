I just read Sherry Turkle's excellent and provocative [Alone Together](http://alonetogetherbook.com) and I plan to put up four wordy posts about it here, more "inspired by" than "review of", which will probably take me a month or so. Does anyone want to join in, either at your own blog or here, to make it a conversation instead of a monologue? If so, either leave a comment or by email  ([here](http://whimsley.typepad.com/about.html)).
