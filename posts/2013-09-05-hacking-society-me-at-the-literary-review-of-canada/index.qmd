				I am thrilled to have a long review of three "internet and society" books in the always-excellent [Literary Review of Canada](http://reviewcanada.ca/). It's online at [http://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2013/09/hacking-society/](http://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2013/09/hacking-society/).

Books covered are: _Networked: The New Social Operating System _by Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman; _Black Code: Inside the Battle for Cyberspace_ by Ronald J. Deibert, and _Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking_ by E. Gabriella Coleman.
