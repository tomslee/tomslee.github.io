Estimates of Uber driver earnings depend on whether the researcher gets access to Uber data.

```{r}
#| label: fig-driver-earnings
#| fig-cap: Uber driver earnings as estimated by several reports
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

librarian::shelf(tidyverse, janitor, ggplot2, ggthemes)

tb <- read_csv("./inprogress/ridehail-driver-earnings/uber-driver-earnings.csv",
               col_type = "DcccllDnn") %>%
    clean_names()

p <- ggplot(data=tb, mapping=aes(x=report_date, y=earnings_us_hr, colour=uber_funded, ))

p + geom_point(size=2) +
  labs(title="Reported earnings of Uber drivers",
       subtitle="Uber-supported is TRUE if the report authors were funded by or employed by Uber,\nor if Uber granted the authors access to company data sets",
       x="Date",
       y="Earnings ($US/hr)") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Uber-supported?")) +
