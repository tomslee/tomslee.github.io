  abstract = {We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing "quantum supremacy" experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain \${\textbackslash}Omega(n)\$ min-entropy, where \$n\$ is the number of qubits. To achieve a net gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits -- thereby "bootstrapping" from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model, and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol's output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its implementation to at most \$n{\textbackslash}sim 60\$ qubits, a regime where attacks are expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and is physically realizable today.},

  abstract = {Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources and developing sustainable energy materials for energy production and storage are critical factors in achieving climate neutrality. These can be realized through innovative strategies to provide viable, economically competitive, and scalable technologies ranging across various sectors. Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize various domains of science and engineering, including macro-energy systems and sustainable energy materials design. Conventional approaches for renewable and sustainable energy systems solely rely on classical computing techniques that may not scale well with the increasing size and complexity of applications. Owing to the advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms, QC and quantum artificial intelligence make promising tools to handle renewable and sustainable energy systems even at larger scales. In this review, we discuss the prospects of QC for various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change. In addition to providing a brief background on the operations of quantum computers, the constituent segments of widely adopted QC-based techniques that improve the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for sustainable energy materials along with quantum artificial intelligence methods that can address complex optimization and machine learning problems arising in renewable energy systems are also introduced in this paper. We screen the presented quantum algorithms based on their performance on current quantum devices despite their promising potential. Furthermore, sustainable energy applications that may draw advantages from QC-based strategies are identified in this work while simultaneously setting realistic expectations over the potential improvements offered over classical techniques.},

This allows us to assign a period to the experimental data without the use of the continued fraction algorithm.

Chemical and biomolecular product design could also benefit from the use of computer-aided solution strategies and computational power to efficiently solve the problems at various scales as the complexity and size of problems grow. In this context, new modes of computation such as quantum computing are receiving increasing attention. While quantum computing has been in development for quite some time, the development of the technology to the point of making commercial use of such resources is quite recent, and still quite limited in scope. However, projections point to a rapid development of quantum computing resources becoming available to academia and industry, which opens potential application areas in chemical and biomolecular product design. With the advent of hybrid algorithms that are able to take advantage of both classical computing and quantum computing resources, as quantum computing grows, more and more problems relevant for chemical product design will become solvable. In this paper, some perspectives are given by identifying a set of needs and challenges for a selected set of opportunities, such as quantum chemistry-based property prediction, protein folding, complex multi-step chemical reactions, and molecular reaction dynamics.},

We model the binding energy of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}\_6\$, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}\_8\$, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}\_\{10\}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}\_\{12\}\$ chains as well as the isomerization of diazene.

Our parameterized ansatz circuits realize the Givens rotation approach to non-interacting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimize to prepare the Hartree-Fock wavefunction. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive corresponds to a rotation of the orbital basis and is required by many proposals for correlated simulations of molecules and Hubbard models. Because non-interacting fermion evolutions are classically tractable to simulate, yet still generate highly entangled states over the computational basis, we use these experiments to benchmark the performance of our hardware while establishing a foundation for scaling up more complex correlated quantum simulations of chemistry.},

Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years.

We develop an approach where the problem is reduced to finding the maximum weighted clique in a graph, and show that Gaussian Boson Samplers can be programmed to sample large-weight cliques, i.e., stable docking configurations, with high probability, even with photon losses. We also describe how outputs from the device can be used to enhance the performance of classical algorithms.

We demonstrate a different strategy using the rare-earth insulator LiY1-xTbxF4 (x\,=\,0.001) which realizes a dense random network of TLS. Some TLS belong to strongly interacting Tb3+ pairs whose quantum states, thanks to localization effects, form highly coherent qubits with 100-fold longer coherence times than single ions. Our understanding of the underlying decoherence mechanisms---and of their suppression---suggests that coherence in networks of dipolar coupled TLS can be enhanced rather than reduced by the interactions.},

However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected ``logical'' qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2,3,4, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10,11,12,13,14,15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code6 distance from d\,=\,3 to d\,=\,7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward large-scale logical processors.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction becomes a practical possibility only if the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on a particular quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit, and decoding algorithm. Here we present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory based on a family of LDPC codes with a high encoding rate that achieves an error threshold of \$0.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the standard circuit-based noise model. This is on par with the surface code which has remained an uncontested leader in terms of its high error threshold for nearly 20 years. The full syndrome measurement cycle for a length-\$n\$ code in our family requires \$n\$ ancillary qubits and a depth-7 circuit composed of nearest-neighbor CNOT gates. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph that consists of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. As a concrete example, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly one million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$. We argue that achieving the same level of error suppression on 12 logical qubits with the surface code would require nearly 3000 physical qubits. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing has rapidly advanced in recent years due to substantial development in both hardware and algorithms. These advances are carrying quantum computers closer to their impending commercial utility. Drug discovery is a promising area of application that will find a number of uses for these new machines. As a prominent example, quantum simulation will enable faster and more accurate characterizations of molecular systems than existing quantum chemistry methods. Furthermore, algorithmic developments in quantum machine learning offer interesting alternatives to classical machine learning techniques, which may also be useful for the biochemical efforts involved in early phases of drug discovery. Meanwhile, quantum hardware is scaling up rapidly into a regime where an exact simulation is difficult even using the world's largest supercomputers. We review how these recent advances can shift the paradigm with which one thinks about drug discovery, focusing on both the promises and caveats associated with each development. In particular, we highlight how hybrid quantum-classical approaches to quantum simulation and quantum machine learning could yield substantial progress using noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, whereas fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computers are still in their development phase.},

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging complexity landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This article is an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing, and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.},

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) treats the case when the matrix is a Hamiltonian. Here, we address the case when the matrix is a density matrix {$\rho$}. We introduce the variational quantum state eigensolver (VQSE), which is analogous to VQE in that it variationally learns the largest eigenvalues of {$\rho$} as well as a gate sequence V that prepares the corresponding eigenvectors. VQSE exploits the connection between diagonalization and majorization to define a cost function \$\$C=\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Tr\}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}rho \}H)\$\$where H is a non-degenerate Hamiltonian. Due to Schur-concavity, C is minimized when \$\${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}rho \}=V{\textbackslash}rho \{V\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}dagger\} \}\$\$is diagonal in the eigenbasis of H. VQSE only requires a single copy of {$\rho$} (only n qubits) per iteration of the VQSE algorithm, making it amenable for near-term implementation. We heuristically demonstrate two applications of VQSE: (1) Principal component analysis, and (2) Error mitigation.},

  abstract = {Determining the ground and excited state properties of materials is considered one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. On near-term hardware, the limiting constraint on such simulations is the requisite circuit depths and qubit numbers, which currently lie well beyond near-term capabilities. Here we develop a quantum algorithm which reduces the estimated cost of material simulations. For example, we obtain a circuit depth improvement by up to 6 orders of magnitude for a Trotter layer of time-dynamics simulation in the transition-metal oxide SrVO3 compared with the best previous quantum algorithms. We achieve this by introducing a collection of connected techniques, including highly localised and physically compact representations of materials Hamiltonians in the Wannier basis, a hybrid fermion-to-qubit mapping, and an efficient circuit compiler. Combined together, these methods leverage locality of materials Hamiltonians and result in a design that generates quantum circuits with depth independent of the system's size. Although the requisite resources for the quantum simulation of materials are still beyond current hardware, our results show that realistic simulation of specific properties may be feasible without necessarily requiring fully scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, providing quantum algorithm design incorporates deeper understanding of the target materials and applications.},

This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we entangled logical qubits encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 times to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and entangled logical qubits encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code with error rates 4.7 times to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify an important transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities toward large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

In particular, it is proposed that the generated samples from the GBS could be harnessed to enhance the classical stochastic algorithms in searching some graph features. Here, we use Jiuzhang, a noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer, to solve graph problems. The samples are generated from a 144-mode fully-connected photonic processor, with photon-click up to 80 in the quantum computational advantage regime. We investigate the open question of whether the GBS enhancement over the classical stochastic algorithms persists -- and how it scales -- with an increasing system size on noisy quantum devices in the computationally interesting regime. We experimentally observe the presence of GBS enhancement with large photon-click number and a robustness of the enhancement under certain noise. Our work is a step toward testing real-world problems using the existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, and hopes to stimulate the development of more efficient classical and quantum-inspired algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates novel techniques to solve prime factorization by quantum annealing (QA). First, we present a very-compact modular encoding of a multiplier circuit into the architecture of current D-Wave QA devices. The key contribution is a compact encoding of a controlled full-adder into an 8-qubit module in the Pegasus topology, which we synthesized using Optimization Modulo Theories. This allows us to encode up to a 21 {\texttimes} 12-bit multiplier (and a 22 {\texttimes} 8-bit one) into the Pegasus 5760-qubit topology of current annealers. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest factorization problems ever encoded into a quantum annealer. Second, we investigated the problem of actually solving encoded PF problems by running an extensive experimental evaluation on a D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer. In the experiments we introduced different approaches to initialize the multiplier qubits and adopted several performance enhancement techniques. Overall, 8,219,999 = 32,749 {\texttimes} 251 was the highest prime product we were able to factorize within the limits of our QPU resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of a quantum annealer; also, this is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of any quantum device without relying on external search or preprocessing procedures run on classical computers.},

The central argument of this book is that the feasibility of quantum computing in the physical world is extremely doubtful. The hypothetical quantum computer is not simply a quantum variant of the conventional digital computer, but rather a quantum extension of a classical analog computer operating with continuous parameters. In order to have a useful machine, the number of continuous parameters to control would have to be of such an astronomically large magnitude as to render the endeavor virtually infeasible. This viewpoint is based on the author's expert understanding of the gargantuan challenges that would have to be overcome to ever make quantum computing a reality. Knowledge of secondary-school-level physics and math will be sufficient for understanding most of the text.},

  abstract = {Numerous reports claim that quantum advantage, which should emerge as a direct consequence of the advent of quantum computers, will herald a new era of chemical research because it will enable scientists to perform the kinds of quantum chemical simulations that have not been possible before. Such simulations on quantum computers, promising a significantly greater accuracy and speed, are projected to exert a great impact on the way we can probe reality, predict the outcomes of chemical experiments, and even drive design of drugs, catalysts, and materials. In this work we review the current status of quantum hardware and algorithm theory and examine whether such popular claims about quantum advantage are really going to be transformative. We go over subtle complications of quantum chemical research that tend to be overlooked in discussions involving quantum computers. We estimate quantum computer resources that will be required for performing calculations on quantum computers with chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum computers for the molecules H\$\_2\$ for increasing basis set sizes, and Cr\$\_2\$ for a variety of complete active spaces (CAS) within the scope of the CASCI and CASSCF methods. The results obtained for the chromium dimer enable us to estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic correlation on a quantum computer should take less time than analogous computations on a classical computer. Using this result, we speculate on the types of chemical applications for which the use of quantum computers would be both beneficial and relevant to industrial applications in the short term.},

Such systems are important in both fluid and kinetic computational plasma physics. This motivates exploring whether a future error-corrected quantum computer could perform these simulations more efficiently than any classical computer. We describe a method for mapping any finite nonlinear dynamical system to an infinite linear dynamical system (embedding) and detail three specific cases of this method that correspond to previously studied mappings. Then we explore an approach for approximating the resulting infinite linear system with finite linear systems (truncation). Using a number of qubits only logarithmic in the number of variables of the nonlinear system, a quantum computer could simulate truncated systems to approximate output quantities if the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak. Other aspects of the computational efficiency of the three detailed embedding strategies are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by such a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques and successfully proving the generalized quantum Stein's lemma. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the formulation of quantum resource theories with the second law, applicable to both static and dynamical resources. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.},

We went on to describe general predictions arising from the argument and proposed general laws that manifest the failure of quantum computers. In October 2019, "Nature" published a paper describing an experimental work that took place at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum (computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer, thus clearly challenging my theory.

A reliable physicochemical understanding of these processes is crucial for the design and synthesis of chemicals and materials of economic value. Although some problems in this field are adequately addressed by classical mechanics, many require an explicit quantum mechanical description. Such quantum problems represented by exponentially large wave function should naturally benefit from quantum computation on a number of logical qubits that scales only linearly with system size. In this perspective, we focus on the potential of quantum computing for solving relevant problems in the molecular sciences -- molecular physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science.},

However, many existing approaches to qubit control suffer from a scale-performance trade-off, impeding progress towards the creation of useful devices. Here, we present a vision for an electronically controlled trapped-ion quantum computer that alleviates this bottleneck. Our architecture utilizes shared current-carrying traces and local tuning electrodes in a microfabricated chip to perform quantum gates with low noise and crosstalk regardless of device size. To verify our approach, we experimentally demonstrate low-noise site-selective single- and two-qubit gates in a seven-zone ion trap that can control up to 10 qubits. We implement electronic single-qubit gates with 99.99916(7)\% fidelity, and demonstrate consistent performance with low crosstalk across the device. We also electronically generate two-qubit maximally entangled states with 99.97(1)\% fidelity and long-term stable performance over continuous system operation. These state-of-the-art results validate the path to directly scaling these techniques to large-scale quantum computers based on electronically controlled trapped-ion qubits.},

  abstract = {A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here~we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000\,years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36\,{$\mu$}s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.},

  abstract = {One of the most promising suggested applications of quantum computing is solving classically intractable chemistry problems. This may help to answer unresolved questions about phenomena like: high temperature superconductivity, solid-state physics, transition metal catalysis, or certain biochemical reactions. In turn, this increased understanding may help us to refine, and perhaps even one day design, new compounds of scientific and industrial importance. However, building a sufficiently large quantum computer will be a difficult scientific challenge. As a result, developments that enable these problems to be tackled with fewer quantum resources should be considered very important. Driven by this potential utility, quantum computational chemistry is rapidly emerging as an interdisciplinary field requiring knowledge of both quantum computing and computational chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to both computational chemistry and quantum computing, bridging the current knowledge gap. We review the major developments in this area, with a particular focus on near-term quantum computation. Illustrations of key methods are provided, explicitly demonstrating how to map chemical problems onto a quantum computer, and solve them. We conclude with an outlook for this nascent field.},

Here we present the realization of a scalable Shor algorithm, as proposed by Kitaev. We factor the number 15 by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four ``cache qubits'' and by implementing generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. This algorithm has been realized scalably within an ion-trap quantum computer and returns the correct factors with a confidence level exceeding 99\%.},

  abstract = {Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations on quantum processors and hinders the coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This incoherent noise is an outstanding challenge to fully leverage the computation power of near-term quantum processors. It has been shown that benchmarking Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) with Cross-Entropy Benchmarking (XEB) can provide a reliable estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available. The extent to which the presence of noise can trivialize the outputs of a given quantum algorithm, i.e. making it spoofable by a classical computation, is an unanswered question. Here, by implementing an RCS algorithm we demonstrate experimentally that there are two phase transitions observable with XEB, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak link model which allows varying the strength of noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting an RCS experiment with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers, even when accounting for the inevitable presence of noise. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.},

The theoretical basis for these experiments depends on sampling the output distributions of random quantum circuits; unfortunately, understanding how this theoretical basis can be used to define quantum supremacy is an extremely difficult task. Anyone attempting to understand how this sampling task relates to quantum supremacy must study concepts from random matrix theory, mathematical analysis, quantum chaos, computational complexity, and probability theory. Resources connecting these concepts in the context of quantum supremacy are scattered and often difficult to find. This article is an attempt to alleviate this difficulty in those who wish to understand the theoretical basis of Google's quantum supremacy experiments, by carefully walking through a derivation of their precise mathematical definition of quantum supremacy. It's designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who want more information than can be provided in popular science articles, but who might not know where to begin when tackling the many research papers related to quantum supremacy.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers can in principle solve certain problems exponentially more quickly than their classical counterparts. We have not yet reached the advent of useful quantum computation, but when we do, it will affect nearly all scientific disciplines. In this review, we examine how current quantum algorithms could revolutionize computational biology and bioinformatics. There are potential benefits across the entire field, from the ability to process vast amounts of information and run machine learning algorithms far more efficiently, to algorithms for quantum simulation that are poised to improve computational calculations in drug discovery, to quantum algorithms for optimization that may advance fields from protein structure prediction to network analysis. However, these exciting prospects are susceptible to ``hype,'' and it is also important to recognize the caveats and challenges in this new technology. Our aim is to introduce the promise and limitations of emerging quantum computing technologies in the areas of computational molecular biology and bioinformatics.

  abstract = {We study the problem of generating independent samples from the output distribution of Google's Sycamore quantum circuits with a target fidelity, which is believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and has been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. We propose a new method to classically solve this problem by contracting the corresponding tensor network just once, and is massively more efficient than existing methods in obtaining a large number of uncorrelated samples with a target fidelity. For the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuit with \$53\$ qubits and \$20\$ cycles, we have generated one million uncorrelated bitstrings \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf s{\textbackslash}\}\$ which are sampled from a distribution \${\textbackslash}hat P({\textbackslash}mathbf s)={\textbar}{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}psi({\textbackslash}mathbf s){\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$, where the approximate state \${\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}psi\$ has fidelity \$F{\textbackslash}approx 0.0037\$. The whole computation has cost about \$15\$ hours on a computational cluster with \$512\$ GPUs. The obtained one million samples, the contraction code and contraction order is made public. If our algorithm could be implemented with high efficiency on a modern supercomputer with ExaFLOPS performance, we estimate that ideally, the simulation would cost a few dozens of seconds, which is faster than Google's quantum hardware.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Quantum computing is an exciting area, which has grown at an astonishing rate in the last decade. It is specially promising for the computational and theoretical chemistry area. One algorithm has received a lot of attention lately, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Is is used to solve electronic structure problems and it is suitable to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. VQE calculations require ansatze and one of the most known is the unitary coupled-cluster (UCC). It uses the chosen basis set to generate a circuit which will be iteratively minimized. The present work investigates the circuit depth as a function of basis sets and molecular size. It has been shown that for the current quantum devices, only the smallest molecules and basis sets are tractable. The H2 molecule with the cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets have circuit depths in the order of 106 to 107 gates and the C2H6 molecule with 3-21G basis set has a circuit depth of 2.2 {\texttimes}108 gates. At the same time the analysis demonstrate that the H2 molecule with STO-3G basis set, requires at least 500 shots to reduce the error and that, although error mitigation schemes can diminish the error, they were not able to completely negate it.},

Europe and Germany are in the process of successfully establishing research and funding programs with the objective to advance the technology's ecosystem and industrialization, thereby ensuring digital sovereignty, security, and competitiveness.

The vision of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC) is to establish and advance the quantum computing ecosystem, supporting the ambitious goals of the German government and various research programs. QUTAC is comprised of ten members representing different industries, in particular automotive manufacturing, chemical and pharmaceutical production, insurance, and technology. In this paper, we survey the current state of quantum computing in these sectors as well as the aerospace industry and identify the contributions of QUTAC to the ecosystem. We propose an application-centric approach for the industrialization of the technology based on proven business impact. This paper identifies 24 different use cases. By formalizing high-value use cases into well-described reference problems and benchmarks, we will guide technological progress and eventually commercialization. Our results will be beneficial to all ecosystem participants, including suppliers, system integrators, software developers, users, policymakers, funding program managers, and investors.},

In the process, we discuss associated models, both pure and disordered, and shed light on implementations and some recent applications of the quantum annealing protocols. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of environmental coupling on quantum annealing. Some possible ways to speed up the annealing protocol in closed systems are elaborated upon: We especially focus on the recipes to avoid discontinuous quantum phase transitions occurring in some models where energy gaps vanish exponentially with the system size.},

We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical computer simulations used to probe these reaction mechanisms, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Our resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers.

  abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging technology with potentially far-reaching implications for national prosperity and security. Understanding the timeframes over which economic benefits and national security risks may manifest themselves is vital for ensuring the prudent development of this technology. To inform security experts and policy decision makers on this matter, we review what is currently known on the potential uses and risks of quantum computers, leveraging current research literature. The maturity of currently-available quantum computers is not yet at a level such that they can be used in production for large-scale, industrially-relevant problems, and they are not believed to currently pose security risks. We identify 2 large-scale trends -- new approximate methods (variational algorithms, error mitigation, and circuit knitting) and the commercial exploration of business-relevant quantum applications -- which, together, may enable useful and practical quantum computing in the near future. Crucially, these methods do not appear likely to change the required resources for cryptanalysis on currently-used cryptosystems. From an analysis we perform of the current and known algorithms for cryptanalysis, we find they require circuits of a size exceeding those that can be run by current and near-future quantum computers (and which will require error correction), though we acknowledge improvements in quantum algorithms for these problems are taking place in the literature. In addition, the risk to cybersecurity can be well-managed by the migration to new, quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, which we survey and discuss. Given the above, we conclude there is a credible expectation that quantum computers will be capable of performing computations which are economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are cryptographically-relevant.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field encompassing various disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer engineering, and computer science. Teaching quantum computing in a concise and effective manner can be challenging, especially within the time constraints of a single course or a short period, even for graduate students. This challenge is particularly relevant in two-year MSc programs that include a thesis, which is a typical structure in higher education systems in the USA and Europe. In this paper, the author proposes an approach to teaching quantum computing and shares their experience of conducting a course chapter on the subject within a two-week time frame. The experience reported in this paper is integrated into the "Technologies of Computing Systems" (TCS) course, with a total workload of 6 ECTS (in the context of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, one ECTS corresponds to 28 hours of work), conducted in one quarter, over seven weeks. The structure of the course chapter is discussed, involving a series of lectures that were accompanied by lab classes and a lab project, allowing students to receive guidance while also engaging in hands-on learning and independent study. The paper provides an overview of the quantum computing topics covered, and their integration in the TSC course, and gives details about how these topics are studied in the different types of classes. It also discusses the evaluation procedure and presents the results obtained. It can be concluded that the inclusion of the quantum computing component not only significantly increased student interest in the course but also effectively bridged the gap between classical and quantum computing for engineering students within a short period of two weeks.},

  abstract = {Pricing financial derivatives on quantum computers typically includes quantum arithmetic components which contribute heavily to the quantum resources required by the corresponding circuits. In this manuscript, we introduce a method based on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) to encode financial derivative payoffs directly into quantum amplitudes, alleviating the quantum circuits from the burden of costly quantum arithmetic. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, we find that for derivative contracts of practical interest, the application of QSP significantly reduces the required resources across all metrics considered, most notably the total number of T-gates by \${\textbackslash}sim 16\$x and the number of logical qubits by \${\textbackslash}sim 4\$x. Additionally, we estimate that the logical clock rate needed for quantum advantage is also reduced by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$x. Overall, we find that quantum advantage will require \$4.7\$k logical qubits, and quantum devices that can execute \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ T-gates at a rate of \$45\$MHz. While in this work we focus specifically on the payoff component of the derivative pricing process where the method we present is most readily applicable, similar techniques can be employed to further reduce the resources in other applications, such as state preparation.},

However, accurately representing the Fermi-Hubbard ground state for large instances may be beyond the reach of near-term quantum hardware. Here we show experimentally that an efficient, low-depth variational quantum algorithm with few parameters can reproduce important qualitative features of medium-size instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model. We address 1\,{\texttimes}\,8 and 2\,{\texttimes}\,4 instances on 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor, substantially larger than previous work based on less scalable compression techniques, and going beyond the family of 1D Fermi-Hubbard instances, which are solvable classically. Consistent with predictions for the ground state, we observe the onset of the metal-insulator transition and Friedel oscillations in 1D, and antiferromagnetic order in both 1D and 2D. We use a variety of error-mitigation techniques, including symmetries of the Fermi-Hubbard model and a recently developed technique tailored to simulating fermionic systems. We also introduce a new variational optimisation algorithm based on iterative Bayesian updates of a local surrogate model.},

It follows our first paper on neutral-atom quantum computing [1]. In the present paper, we provide a survey on the current state-of-the-art in trapped-ion quantum computing, taking up again the perspective of an industrial end-user. To this end, our paper covers, on the one hand, a comprehensive introduction to the physical foundations and mechanisms that play an important role in operating a trapped-ion quantum computer. On the other hand, we provide an overview of the key performance metrics that best describe and characterise such a device's current computing capability. These metrics encompass performance indicators such as qubit numbers, gate times and errors, native gate sets, qubit stability and scalability as well as considerations regarding the general qubit types and trap architectures. In order to ensure that these metrics reflect the current state of trapped-ion quantum computing as accurate as possible, they have been obtained by both an extensive review of recent literature and, more importantly, from discussions with various quantum hardware vendors in the field. We combine these factors and provide -- again from an industrial end-user perspective -- an overview of what is currently possible with trapped-ion quantum computers, which algorithms and problems are especially suitable for this platform, what are the relevant end-to-end wall clock times for calculations, and what might be possible with future fault-tolerant trapped-ion quantum computers.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing promises to help humanity solve problems that would otherwise be intractable on classical computers. Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities: 1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems. 2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines. 3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure. This paper discusses each in turn.},

Here, we present the AutoRXN workflow, an automated workflow for exploratory high-throughput lectronic structure calculations of molecular systems, in which (i) density functional theory methods are exploited to deliver minimum and transition-state structures and corresponding energies and properties, (ii) coupled cluster calculations are then launched for optimized structures to provide more accurate energy and property estimates, and (iii) multi-reference diagnostics are evaluated to back check the coupled cluster results and subject hem to automated multi-configurational calculations for potential multi-configurational cases. All calculations are carried out in a cloud environment and support massive computational campaigns. Key features of all omponents of the AutoRXN workflow are autonomy, stability, and minimum operator interference. We highlight the AutoRXN workflow at the example of an autonomous reaction mechanism exploration of the mode of action of a homogeneous catalyst for the asymmetric reduction of ketones.},

A critical challenge for VQE in practice is that one needs to strike a balance between the expressivity of the VQE ansatz versus the number of quantum gates required to implement the ansatz, given the reality of noisy quantum operations on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we consider an orbital-optimized pair-correlated approximation to the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (uCCSD) ansatz and report a highly efficient quantum circuit implementation for trapped-ion architectures. We show that orbital optimization can recover significant additional electron correlation energy without sacrificing efficiency through measurements of low-order reduced density matrices (RDMs). In the dissociation of small molecules, the method gives qualitatively accurate predictions in the strongly-correlated regime when running on noise-free quantum simulators. On IonQ's Harmony and Aria trapped-ion quantum computers, we run end-to-end VQE algorithms with up to 12 qubits and 72 variational parameters---the largest full VQE simulation with a correlated wave function on quantum hardware. We find that even without error mitigation techniques, the predicted relative energies across different molecular geometries are in excellent agreement with noise-free simulators.},

We examine the constraints on the region of quantum advantage for quantum circuits with a larger number of qubits and gates than experimentally implemented. At near-term gate fidelities, we demonstrate that quantum supremacy is limited to circuits with a qubit count and circuit depth of a few hundred. Larger circuits encounter two distinct boundaries: a return of a classical advantage and practically infeasible quantum runtimes. Decreasing error rates cause the region of a quantum advantage to grow rapidly. At error rates required for early implementations of the surface code, the largest circuit size within the quantum supremacy regime coincides approximately with the smallest circuit size needed to implement error correction. Thus, the boundaries of quantum supremacy may fortuitously coincide with the advent of scalable, error-corrected quantum computing.},
