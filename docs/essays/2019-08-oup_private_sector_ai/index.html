      <p>Algorithms that sort people into categories are plagued by incompatible incentives. While more accurate algorithms may address problems of statistical bias and unfairness, they cannot solve the ethical challenges that arise from incompatible incentives. Subjects of algorithmic decisions seek to optimize their outcomes, but such efforts may degrade the accuracy of the algorithm. To maintain their accuracy, algorithms must be accompanied by supplementary rules: “guardrails”“that dictate the limits of acceptable behaviour by subjects. Algorithm owners are drawn into taking on the tasks of governance, managing and validating the behaviour of those who interact with their systems. The governance role offers temptations to indulge in regulatory arbitrage. If governance is left to algorithm owners, it may lead to arbitrary and restrictive controls on individual behaviour. The goal of algorithmic governance by automated decision systems, social media recommender systems, and rating systems is a mirage, retreating into the distance whenever we seem to approach it.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Individuals present themselves to the world in a set of performances, and tune their presentation depending on the setting.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We may not believe there is a single “real” person behind these performances, but we do expect to see a “coherence among setting, appearance, and manner” (p.25).

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Since branding became important to companies, they too have presented themselves to the world in a set of performances. Financial incentives demand they tune their performance to the setting—offering a generous and humane face in their public communications and a harsher and less empathetic one when managing the bottom line—while the ethical demand for coherence remains. Two decades ago the movement against corporate-led globalization highlighted these presentation gaps, captured in the dissonance between Nike’s empowering “Just Do It” to those who bought their sneakers, and the far-from-empowering sweatshop conditions endured by those who made them.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> One legacy of that movement is a set of ethical consumption initiatives, in which independent fair trade and sustainability certifications provide an opportunity for companies to demonstrate a coherent set of values behind their performances.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Naomi Klein, <em>No Logo</em> (Toronto: Knopf Canada, 2000).</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Kimberley Ann Elliott and Richard B.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Now, in the debates over AI ethics, it is technology companies who find themselves accused of being two-faced, of presenting themselves through their brands as value-driven organizations while deploying algorithms<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> that are too often biased, opaque, and unfair.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;In this chapter, <em>algorithm</em> is shorthand for any automated data-driven sorting systems, including classifying, scoring, rating, and ranking.

<p>Charges of bias and unfairness expose AI algorithms that are, in some sense, not good enough, and emphasize that the solution is better algorithms. But another set of problems may become <em>more</em> significant as algorithms become more accurate: when they become too good not to use. This chapter focuses on this second gap, which cannot be translated into research projects to be solved by computer scientists.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>This chapter draws loosely on social science perspectives to sketch what can happen when we respond to algorithms, and the consequences of our responses.</p>
<p>Imagine an algorithm that sorts individual subjects into categories. If subjects care about their assigned category, then they have an incentive to optimize how they present themselves: changing their inputs to achieve a better output. Their decision to invest in this presentation depends on three factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Presentation cost.</strong> The subject must be able to afford to change their presentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitivity.</strong> Changing an input feature is worthwhile only if it affects the output.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact.</strong> Changing an output is worthwhile only if it has significant consequences.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Algorithms with high impact, high sensitivity, and low presentation costs give subjects strong incentives to change their presentation. Following the terminology of economics, we can loosely say that such algorithms have high <strong>elasticity</strong>. The data distributions on which elastic algorithms operate when deployed will differ from those on which it was trained. When data distributions change, accuracy is lost: elastic algorithms may also be <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>
<p>There are reasons to believe that machine learning systems, and specifically deep learning systems, may be particularly elastic and fragile, mapping on to each of the factors above.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>First is the low cost of experimentation around presentation. Deep learning techniques called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> have become excellent at generating images or videos or text that look as if they were created by humans or depict “real world” artefacts.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>There is growing evidence that the remarkable accuracy of deep learning models may be accompanied by high sensitivity.

<p>Many machine learning systems have high impact because they are deployed at scale. We may not want to invest in optimizing our LinkedIn profile, but if we are seeking work and that’s where employers look we have little alternative but to put our best foot forward. Scale also creates market opportunities for cost-lowering intermediaries who can assist with optimization, as with search-engine optimization, reputation management or, come to that, tax accountancy. Scale makes algorithmic flaws matter more than those of any one human.</p>
<p>As deep learning drives the next generation of decision support systems and recommender systems, their elasticity and fragility may become increasingly important. To make matters more serious, these weaknesses will not show up in proofs of concept or early stage deployments, where the output has little impact on subjects. It is only when algorithms are operating at scale that the incentive to invest becomes large, making the system more fragile.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Figure 3 classifies responses to algorithms. Algorithms require <em>valid</em> input if they are to give correct output. Algorithms also have an <em>intent</em> that can be affected positively or negatively by the actions of subjects. In general, the output is a proxy for this less well-defined intent.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Each input arrow may be paired with each output arrow, giving four classes of response. While algorithm designers may prefer to permit only valid inputs which sustain the intent of the system, all four combinations can have ethical justifications.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn30"><p><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Cathy O’Neill, <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em> (Crown Random House, 2016).</p></li></div></div>
<p>Valid inputs can be understood by thinking about a simple rule-based system, such as a hiring filter that sorts applicants based solely on educational achievements. The input is a subject’s educational achievements: genuine achievements are valid and fake achievements are not. The intent of the system is to give the hiring manager a good set of interviewees: if he or she is happy with their applicants the system’s intent is satisfied.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In cases that economists describe as separating equilibria for signalling and screening games,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> valid inputs sustain the intent of the algorithm. If the applicant pool consists of two qualities from an employment perspective (high and low), and if getting a degree is easier for high quality people than for low quality people, then only high-quality people find it worth investing in a degree. The beauty of such an arrangement is that it is “incentive compatible”: an “invisible hand” guides subjects so that, if they respond to incentives, the algorithm continues to satisfy its intent without additional governance.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn31"><p><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Michael A. Spence, “Job Market Signaling,” <em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> 87, no. 3 (1973): 355–74; Joseph E. Stiglitz, <em>Whither Socialism?</em>, The Wicksell Lectures (Cambridge Massachusetts, London England: The MIT Press, 1994).</p></li></div></div>
<p>If it is equally costly for low quality applicants to obtain a degree as for high quality applicants, then the degree ceases to be a useful signal. Applicants may continue to invest in degrees, but the algorithm will no longer separate the wheat from the chaff. This is the game-theoretic case of a “pooling equilibrium”, where valid responses erode the intent of the algorithm. We know how the verb describing valid responses in pooling equilibria declines: I follow the letter of the law, you teach to the test, he or she games the system. The problems of pooling equilibria have been elevated to the status of a Law: “Goodhart’s Law” states that “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure” to which we might add a corollary that becomes important below: “When a measure is not a target, it ceases to be optimized”.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The ethics of optimizing responses using valid input is not simple. One reason Google keeps its search algorithms secret is to prevent gaming by the search-engine optimization industry,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> but when it comes to the tax system their attitude is different. A secret tax system would be unacceptable, of course. Accused of dodging taxes by moving $23bn to Bermuda, Google responded simply: “We pay all of the taxes due and comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the world”.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn32"><p><sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Jonathan Rosenberg, “The Meaning of Open,” December 21, 2009, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2009/12/meaning-of-open.html" class="uri">http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2009/12/meaning-of-open.html</a>.</p></li><li id="fn33"><p><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Reuters, “Google Shifted $23bn to Tax Haven Bermuda in 2017, Filing Shows | Technology | The Guardian,” <em>The Guardian</em>, January 3, 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/03/google-tax-haven-bermuda-netherlands" class="uri">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/03/google-tax-haven-bermuda-netherlands</a>.</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><em>Workarounds</em> are a class of invalid inputs that nevertheless sustain the intent of the system. Legal scholar Jennifer Raso investigated the operation of Ontario Works, a welfare-eligibility decision system,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> and found that case workers became experts at working with the system, on occasions entering false data to coax results that line up with their professional judgment. Whether dealing with bugs in the program (an inapplicable field for some applicants would also be a required field in the system) or with weaknesses in the model, case workers break the letter of the law to follow the spirit. Similar behaviour has been seen among US doctors seeking to provide their patients with good outcomes from insurance systems.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn34"><p><sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Jennifer Raso, “Displacement as Regulation: New Regulatory Technologies and Front-Line Decision-Making in Ontario Works,” <em>Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Society / La Revue Canadienne Droit et Société</em> 32, no. 1 (April 2017): 75–95, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/cls.2017.6" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1017/cls.2017.6</a>.</p></li><li id="fn35"><p><sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Matthew K.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Any statistical algorithm has error cases, and many systems cannot function without workarounds from those it manages or their agents, which is why “work to rule” actions in some industrial settings are common: if you follow the letter of the law too strictly, nothing gets done. The unappreciated role of workarounds is one reason why James C. Scott argues that “certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>&nbsp;Scott is arguing against top-down “high-modernist” schemes, and algorithmic platforms certainly fall into this category.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn36"><p><sup>36</sup>&nbsp;James C. Scott, <em>Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed</em> (Yale University Press, 1998).</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The final case is invalid input that also erodes an algorithm’s intent, often described in security terms, as <em>attacks</em> on the algorithm. There are an increasing number of algorithms for which “opting out” is not an option, including ratings platforms. <em>Botto Bistro</em> is a San Francisco restaurant which was unhappy with what they saw as unethical treatment by Yelp, who also refused the restaurant’s request to be removed from the platform. In response, <em>Botto Bistro</em> encouraged its customers to enter over-the-top one-star reviews, seeking to achieve the lowest rating on Yelp. The campaign called attention to some dubious practices and contradictions in Yelp’s operations: perhaps a case of principled protest or subversive humour, sabotaging one system in pursuit of a higher goal.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn37"><p><sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Tom Slee, “In Praise of Fake Reviews,” <em>The New Inquiry</em>, October 29, 2014, <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/in-praise-of-fake-reviews/" class="uri">https://thenewinquiry.com/in-praise-of-fake-reviews/</a>.</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The more sophisticated and complex the algorithm, the more the lines between these four categories blur. Once algorithms move beyond simple inputs such as birth dates and educational qualifications, the criteria for distinguishing valid from invalid input become uncertain. Reputation systems such as Yelp, eBay, and Uber replace “true or false” criteria with more nebulous notions of “authenticity” or “honesty” and defend them not by appeals to correctness but to free speech.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="responses-demand-guardrails">Responses demand guardrails</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In general, algorithms that classify people are “incentive-incompatible”: if subjects follow their incentives then the algorithm ceases to function as designed. To sustain their accuracy, algorithms need external rules to limit permissible responses. These rules form a set of <em>guardrails</em> which implement value judgments, keeping algorithms functioning by constraining the actions of subjects.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn41"><p><sup>41</sup>&nbsp;The metaphor adopts the designer’s point of view; from a subject’s point of view, “straitjacket” may be more appropriate.</p></li></div></div>
<p>“Move fast and break things” norms of disruptive innovation encourage algorithm designers to postpone thinking about guardrails. They may not be needed in low-elasticity environments such as proofs of concept or in early-stage deployments. Still, successful deployments at scale will require guardrails and so, even if problems of bias and fairness could be solved, the grail of algorithmic governance—of impartial and automatic algorithmic data-driven and evidence-based decision-making—would fall at this hurdle. Algorithms and their guardrails form an inseparable pair. Code is law, until it is not.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The existence of a scalable algorithm does not imply the existence of equally scalable guardrails: guardrails must deal with specific contexts and factors outside the original model, which only grow in number as algorithms draw on an ever-increasing volume and variety of data in pursuit of accuracy. Attempts to implement automated moderation have repeatedly failed, and companies have resorted instead to what Astra Taylor calls “fauxtomation”: behind the scenes real people do the work to simulate the effects of an algorithm, because the technology is not up to the task.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> The work of content moderators has been described recently by Sarah Roberts<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> and Tarleton Gillespie.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn42"><p><sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Astra Taylor, “The Automation Charade,” Logic Magazine, October 2, 2018, <a href="https://logicmag.io/05-the-automation-charade/" class="uri">https://logicmag.io/05-the-automation-charade/</a>.</p></li><li id="fn43"><p><sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Sarah Roberts, “Commercial Content Moderation: Digital Laborers’ Dirty Work,” in <em>Intersectional Internet: Race, Sex, Class and Culture Online</em>, ed.&nbsp;Safiya Umoja Noble and Brendesha M Tynes, Digital Formations Series (Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., 2016), <a href="https://intersectionalinternet.com/about/" class="uri">https://intersectionalinternet.com/about/</a>; Sarah T.

<p>Algorithms without guardrails may become ungovernable. Social media recommender algorithms, for example, have all three qualities needed for high elasticity. Experimentation is affordable, content producers can discover the kind of content to which the recommendation algorithm is sensitive because they get fast feedback in the form of view counts, and the impact of the recommendation system is high.

<p>When some trend, such as Surprise Egg videos, reaches critical mass, content producers pile onto it, creating thousands and thousands more of these videos in every possible iteration… branded content and nursery rhyme titles and “surprise egg” all stuffed into the same word salad to capture search results, sidebar placement, and “up next” autoplay rankings…</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Ironically, it was Bridle’s essay going viral that made YouTube act, and they did so by invoking community guidelines.

<p>The same article quotes Davey Orgill, who left his job to make superhero parody videos, and whose channel reached two million viewers before being shut down. He argued that “the platform is responsible for encouraging… objectionable, sexual, and violent superhero content ostensibly oriented toward children… YouTube blames it on these people that were doing it, but for a year their algorithm pushed this content… People were doing it because it was creating millions and millions and millions of views. They created a monster.” The left hand of the recommendation algorithms promotes videos that the right hand of the Community Guidelines would later forbid.</p>
<p>Bridle ends his essay this way: “The architecture they have built to extract the maximum revenue from online video is being hacked by persons unknown to abuse children, perhaps not even deliberately, but at a massive scale,” but the disturbing videos are not “hacking” any more than minimizing tax payments is hacking, they are responses driven by the algorithm itself.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Facebook’s News Feed algorithm also suffers from high elasticity and its problems have also been framed as those of defence against malicious actors. Former Facebook executive Antonio Garcia Martinez complained on Twitter that “The same FB [Facebook] critics who call on the company to take on responsibility for moderating content (an operational job they (Facebook) don’t want, and had to be pressed to perform), will of course be shocked, shocked at the human cost in reviewing billions of pieces of random content”.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> But the requirement for guardrails .</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn48"><p><sup>48</sup>&nbsp;Tweet since deleted.</p></li></div></div>

<p>The assumption fails. An elastic system based on “the data” causes the foundations on which it is built to shift. The incentive-incompatible News Feed algorithm demands guardrails to police the content it generates.</p>
<p>If Facebook does not want the job of managing news content, it could hand it to the news industry. Emily Bell of the Columbia Journalism School explains:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote page-columns page-full">

<p>In short, guardrails limit the autonomy of algorithmic subjects. Algorithmic governance may encourage platforms to innovate with A/B testing on their subjects, but the subjects themselves are constrained. Some may be punished twice over: once by the algorithm for unorthodox behaviour that it does not properly model, and a second time if they fall foul of the guardrails while trying to avoid the first.</p>
</section>
<section id="guardrails-create-temptation" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guardrails-create-temptation">Guardrails create temptation</h2>
<p>The algorithm-guardrail pairing creates temptations for platform owners to indulge in arbitrage: exploiting presentation gaps to circumvent regulation and to avoid brand damage. When algorithms encourage behaviour that the guardrails forbid, platform companies may choose whether to present themselves through their algorithm or through the values imposed by their guardrails. Ethics calls for a consistent presentation, but companies have a financial incentive to keep the gap wide, and many activities can be seen in this light.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>One response is to frame problems in terms of the software development lifecycle. Problems are bugs, and the software industry knows how to deal with bugs: they are reported, they are fixed, and fixes are rolled out to customers. It is a statement of faith that bugs are temporary, and software improves through iterative refinement. If algorithmic failings are bugs, external authorities have neither the jurisdiction nor the expertise to fix them. But as we have seen, guardrail failures are features not bugs: they are created by the incentives built into the algorithm. In her book “Uberland”, Alex Rosenblat talks of Uber drivers seeing “phantom requests” that appear briefly on the driver app but vanish before they can respond.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Phantom requests damage drivers’ prospects of earning bonuses that depend on maintaining a high acceptance rate. Uber’s response to driver complaints was to blame it on network problems and promise a fix. Without effective person-to-person driver support, Uber denies drivers the option of a workaround, while the language and practices of software development helps the company avoid what would, in other companies, be a breach of contract with their drivers.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn58"><p><sup>58</sup>&nbsp;Alex Rosenblat, <em>Uberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work</em> (University of California Press, 2018), <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520298576/uberland" class="uri">https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520298576/uberland</a>.</p></li></div></div>
<p>A second response is to invoke value-based guardrails in an ad-hoc manner. If algorithmic governance leads to behaviour on the part of subjects that may damage the brand, it is tempting to let it go until the prospect becomes too dangerous. YouTube’s actions around the YouTube Kids channel fall into this pattern.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Airbnb is an algorithmically-governed platform with a stated intent of the building a community of regular people who live in their own home and occasionally share it with strangers. Any guardrails to keep behaviour within this mandate runs the risk of affecting Airbnb’s earnings, and so there has been nothing in Airbnb’s systems to stop hosts creating multiple listings, setting up organizations with different “hosts” as fronts,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> or renting out listings for 365 nights a year. When the gap between algorithmic practices and stated aims became too large in New York City, bringing the threat of restrictions on Airbnb’s market, the company invoked guardrails to expel a thousand hosts off its platform,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> claiming that they were not providing the experience their community expected.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> Code was overruled by brand.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn59"><p><sup>59</sup>&nbsp;Luis Ferré-Sadurní, “Inside the Rise and Fall of a Multimillion-Dollar Airbnb Scheme,” <em>The New York Times</em>, February 23, 2019, sec.&nbsp;New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/nyregion/airbnb-nyc-law.html" class="uri">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/nyregion/airbnb-nyc-law.html</a>.</p></li><li id="fn60"><p><sup>60</sup>&nbsp;Murray Cox and Tom Slee, “How Airbnb Hid the Facts in New York City,” February 7, 2016, <a href="http://tomslee.net/how-airbnb-hid-the-facts-in-nyc" class="uri">http://tomslee.net/how-airbnb-hid-the-facts-in-nyc</a>.</p></li><li id="fn61"><p><sup>61</sup>&nbsp;Kristen V.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A third temptation is to use the platform’s information resources to hide or muddy the waters regarding algorithmic failures. Ryan Calo and Alex Rosenblat have detailed the many ways in which Uber has used its information to shape the behaviour of its drivers.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> The selective and judicious release of data on an exclusive basis for collaboration with academics or industry experts may also serve to shape the overall perception of the company, whether individual papers are written independently or not.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn62"><p><sup>62</sup>&nbsp;Ryan Calo and Alex Rosenblat, “The Taking Economy: Uber, Information, and Power,” <em>Columbia Law Review</em> 117 (March 9, 2017), <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2929643" class="uri">https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2929643</a>.</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Finally: companies that become embedded into the infrastructure of our lives have leverage when it comes to the presentation gap. Uber seeks to become a privately-owned part of city transit infrastructure and uses the data it has accumulated as a resource to be licensed back to the cities in which they operate. Once integrated, cities cannot easily walk away from the platform, problems on the platform become public concerns regarding malicious actors, and cities’ leverage regarding governance on the Uber platform is lost. Smart City initiatives such as the Toronto project led by Google subsidiary Sidewalk implicitly adopt this same approach.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn63"><p><sup>63</sup>&nbsp;See the chapter by Ellen Goodman in this book.</p></li></div></div>

<p>The more powerful algorithms have become, the more it is clear that market forces alone cannot solve the problems arising from the incompatible incentives.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Platform companies can sustain a gap between algorithm and guardrail in part because Section 230 of the CDA absolves them of much responsibility for the consequences of their governance failures, in the USA at least. Chesney and Citron’s recent paper on Deep Fakes<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> identify the platform companies as the “least cost avoider”: the actor who is in the best position to fix problems of incompatible incentives. The previous section claimed that platforms currently have an incentive to take ownership of the problem, but not to fix it: that taking ownership is currently a way to ward off regulation. Revisiting Section 230 and its equivalents in other jurisdictions does the opposite.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn64"><p><sup>64</sup>&nbsp;Chesney and Citron, “Deep Fakes.”</p></li></div></div>
<p>One of society’s most serious classification problems is that of “innocent or guilty”, and it worth remembering that data-driven statistical methods are not permitted in this venue: evidence is instead strictly limited in scope. One reason is that people should not be punished for factors that, while they may correlate with criminality, lie outside their control. Another is that it would demand that people, especially members of less privileged groups, invest in optimizing their risk scores for fear of contact with the criminal system. “Evidence-based” statistical decision-making has become increasingly used in areas of the justice system such as parole and even sentencing and its use raises both problems. While the trend remains towards data-driven decisions, voices are being raised against use of actuarial risk assessment in the justice system. Restricting data use goes against the grain of the current drive to a data-driven society, but as the impact of algorithmic decisions grows, ideas from this venue where decisions matter the most may become more prominent in the years to come.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Competition rules provide another avenue to resolving incentive problems. Algorithmic ranking systems can become powerful institutions in and of themselves: part of the infrastructure of society. Advantages accrue to the company that owns the infrastructure when it is also competing in the market for services that exploit that infrastructure.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn65"><p><sup>65</sup>&nbsp;Lina M Khan, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” <em>The Yale Law Journal</em> 126 (2017): 710– 805.</p></li></div></div>
<p>In some industries the essential infrastructure is heavily regulated and controlled, while services built on that infrastructure are opened for innovation. Airport infrastructure is separated from the operation of airlines. Core banking functions are strictly regulated – perhaps not as strictly as some would like – while many countries are experimenting with open banking laws to permit innovation on top of this infrastructure.</p>
<p>Outside the realm of regulation, we can look to alternative models. Wikipedia is the only non-profit in the top ranks of web sites, and it has been significantly less affected by the problems of incompatible incentives. Many, the present author included, thought that Wikipedia would be unable to maintain quality over nearly two decades, but it has proven sceptics wrong. Perhaps the anonymous nature of contributions removes many of the distorting incentives associated with self-promotion, perhaps it’s because Wikipedia is largely free of “viral” phenomena, but something is working on Wikipedia that is not working at YouTube, Facebook, or Amazon.</p>
<p>In conclusion, deep learning algorithms may be more intelligent than previous generations of machine learning, but they are not more robust. There may be a faint technical path forward for problems of bias and unfairness, but algorithms are engines, not cameras, and pervasive incompatible incentives will remain. Algorithms require guardrails, and technology companies are ill-suited and ill-positioned to design or implement these value-based rules. Guardrails become constraints on people’s behaviour and yet, in cases of high elasticity, effective governance may still be elusive. The pairing of the algorithm and guardrails tempts companies to engage in regulatory arbitrage, providing a requirement for external action.</p>
