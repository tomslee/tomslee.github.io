<pre><code>            Waterloo is an interesting place to live these days for an&nbsp;ex-quantum-mechanic, mainly because of all that techno-geek BlackBerry&nbsp;money that is being splashed around. When I bike to work I go past the&nbsp;Perimeter Institute in Theoretical Physics at the beginning of my ride,&nbsp;and then go within a stone's throw of the Institute for Quantum&nbsp;Computing at the end, both of which are making waves these days. All&nbsp;these brainy young things pushing the boundaries of what we know and&nbsp;don't know, it's fun to watch.</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;main media event recently has been the publication of the book “The&nbsp;Trouble with Physics” by the Perimeter Insitute’s Lee Smolin, which is&nbsp;a criticism of String Theory and its 30-year failure to prove itself as&nbsp;something more than a promising candidate for a theory of everything.&nbsp;Smolin’s book has been widely reviewed, often in conjunction with Peter&nbsp;Woit’s “Not Even Wrong” which argues much the same thing. The title&nbsp;“Not Even Wrong” was a devastating putdown coined by Enrico Fermi of&nbsp;another physicist’s work - the implication being it was so mistaken&nbsp;that you couldn’t even show why and how it was incorrect. My own work&nbsp;was in the relatively mundane work of molecules rather than&nbsp;cosmological elementary particles; that is, it was quantum, but on our&nbsp;side of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, not the other side. Both&nbsp;books argue that String Theory has become so removed from experiment&nbsp;that it has ceased to be science, and has become prone to building&nbsp;elaborate edifices on an insufficiently sound physical basis.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;PI has made the biggest splash locally, the Institute for Quantum&nbsp;Computing is a rising star too. And Quantum Computing is something that&nbsp;I feel I can get more of a handle on than String Theory, so I’ve been&nbsp;reading a bit about it. And what I see either exposes me for a&nbsp;quantum fuddy-duddy or suggests that Quantum Computing (QC from here&nbsp;on) could do with listening to the critiques of Smolin and applying it&nbsp;to themselves.</p>
<p>So here is what’s wrong with quantum computing from what&nbsp;I can see. (Disclaimer: these opinions are based on a number of popular&nbsp;articles, my attempts to follow Scott Aaronson’s excellent weblog <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">Shtetl-Optimized</a>,&nbsp;and the bit I have read of Jozef Gruska’s 1999 text “Quantum&nbsp;Computing”, which I actually got out of the library last week. These&nbsp;opinions are worth exactly what you paid for them.)</p>
<p>Reading a QC&nbsp;book is an odd thing for a regular physics type. Where are the&nbsp;Hamiltonians? Few and far between, it seems (“Hamiltonian” is mentioned&nbsp;in only a literal handful of places – five – in Gruska). Everything&nbsp;is about the action of unitary operators on states. For anyone reading&nbsp;this who is not a physicist, here’s what that means. In physics, when&nbsp;things interact, that interaction is described by a Hamiltonian. If&nbsp;you’re trying to solve a problem, your first step is to construct a&nbsp;Hamiltonian operator that describes the interaction you are studying,&nbsp;and then solve the equations that come from that. Unitary operators, on&nbsp;the other hand, describe a change in a quantum system from one state to&nbsp;another, which may sound like the same thing but isn’t. In regular&nbsp;computers, circuits consist of many gates that carry out elementary&nbsp;operations (AND, OR, and so on). If you had a quantum “gate” then a&nbsp;unitary operator describes the change from input to output (that’s the change in state), and ignores the way in which the system gets from the&nbsp;one end of the gate to the other. The Hamiltonian would describe the&nbsp;actual physical operation that happens as the light or electron or&nbsp;nuclear spin goes from the input to the output.</p>
<p>That still&nbsp;might not be very clear, so here’s the end result: the theory of QC is&nbsp;built in a manner that has become deliberately divorced from the real world.&nbsp;The “implementation” or the actual building of a computer is&nbsp;consciously separated from the theory of the logic and algorithms that&nbsp;you would build on top of this computer. There is a division of labour&nbsp;between theory and experiment that is present right down to the way the&nbsp;theory is constructed, and that is a bit of a problem because it means&nbsp;that every single thing that the theorists say is conditional. All the theorems they prove need a big asterisk next to them saying “as long as&nbsp;someone can make a computer”. As a footnote Richard Feynman, who knew what&nbsp;he was doing, did some early explorations in Quantum Computing and did&nbsp;approach it by building Hamiltonians and putting together Schrodinger&nbsp;equations - just what you’d expect a physicist to do.</p>
<p>You can see why the discipline&nbsp;has gone in this manner. Regular old classical computing, after all,&nbsp;followed a similar path. It started off with mathematicians (von&nbsp;Neumann and Turing) who set out a logical architecture of computers and&nbsp;algorithms, and this work was followed (loosely speaking, and as best I&nbsp;understand) by the engineers once the transistor was invented. And it&nbsp;makes sense that those interested in exploring algorithms can do so&nbsp;without needing to know all about welding - this stuff is complicated&nbsp;enough as it is. But we should keep in mind that there is always the&nbsp;possibility that the success of regular computing will not be repeated.&nbsp;The proof of the pudding and all that.</p>
<p>The second thing that bothers me about QC is related to this&nbsp;division of labour. Everywhere you look they are talking about “entanglement” and all&nbsp;the things that go along with it: Bell’s inequalities, EPR experiments&nbsp;and so on. In Gruska’s book Everett (of the “many-worlds interpretation”) is&nbsp;mentioned as many times as Hamiltonian. Again, for a quantum fuddy-duddy this raises red flags. The wierdness of the quantum world is&nbsp;seductive - enough that my 1st year lecturer (the late Peter Dawber) felt he had to warn us&nbsp;“this is interesting, but it’s interpretation. My advice is learn how&nbsp;to calculate and solve problems, and don’t get stuck in the&nbsp;philosophical quicksand”. Good advice that has been repeated by many a&nbsp;lecturer, I’m sure. And yet here are these QC-ers diving headlong into&nbsp;entangled states, and spending more time on them than on things with&nbsp;actual Hamiltonians. Looking in Gruska’s index again, entanglement&nbsp;merits 42 mentions. Perhaps this is mainly a rhetorical point,&nbsp;but I do think it is worth making because entanglement is built into&nbsp;the culture of quantum computing.</p>
<p>Entanglement is connected to what&nbsp;happens when you prepare a multi-particle quantum state and then let&nbsp;the particles become separated. So you get paragraphs like this:</p>
<p>Prepare&nbsp;a system with two particles, each of which can have two values of spin,&nbsp;and send them off in opposite directions. Then measure one of the&nbsp;particles to find its spin. This measurement then immediately fixes the spin of the other particle, even though it’s a long way away. The state of the two particles is entangled.</p>
<p>But you could also write this paragraph this way.</p>
<p>Prepare&nbsp;a system with two particles, each of which can have two values&nbsp;of spin, and send them off in opposite directions. Then measure the&nbsp;state of the system by checking one particle. This measurement tells&nbsp;you the spin of both particles.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;difference is that in the second phrasing avoids mention of&nbsp;entanglement, and focuses on the fact that this is a single quantum&nbsp;system we are talking about here, and that however far apart the two&nbsp;particles end up being, they still have to comprise a single quantum&nbsp;system, and that means _no messing _from the classical world. The two&nbsp;paragraphs refer to the same operations and mathematics, but the second avoids extraneous weirdness.</p>
<p>The two most mature&nbsp;methods of actually preparing quantum computers are NMR spectroscopy&nbsp;and ion traps. Ion traps deal with fine control of isolated quantum&nbsp;systems (as required for “entanglement”) and involves very exotic and&nbsp;incredibly precise experimental apparatus. This is what you would&nbsp;expect if you are dealing with single systems: the expense of dealing&nbsp;with them grows as the size of the separation grows. NMR deals with&nbsp;many systems (<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/physics/publications/press/print/97.04.inq.pdf#search=%22quantum%20computing%20coffee%20cup%22">coffee cups</a>, for example - the link is to a PDF file) and uses the fancy techniques of pulsed magnetic resonance&nbsp;to give these systems a variety of kicks. It’s recently been extended&nbsp;to 12 “qubits” (individual spins), which is the biggest quantum&nbsp;computer to date.</p>
<p>But here is the odd thing, this most&nbsp;successful technique is not based on the single systems that are needed&nbsp;for entanglement. In fact, these same multi-pulse NMR experiments have&nbsp;been carried out for some years and the word “entanglement” never&nbsp;raised its head so far as I know until the Quantum Computation people&nbsp;got interested. In NMR you are dealing with qubits that are not spatially separated (they are nuclei on the same molecule) and you are&nbsp;not dealing with a single quantum system described by a single state&nbsp;vector (you are dealing with a thermodynamic ensemble of quantum&nbsp;systems described by a density matrix). Myself, I could never follow&nbsp;the theory of multi-pulse NMR, but I’m pretty sure there was no mention&nbsp;of many-world interpretations in it.</p>
<p>So QC should realise that&nbsp;the consequences of “entanglement” are limited to inherently exotic&nbsp;systems with which you are unlikely to be able to build a real&nbsp;computer. It’s useful in PR material to highlight the weirdness of the&nbsp;quantum world, but when talking science you should follow Occam, who&nbsp;said “avoid talking weirdness whenever possible”. For example, when QC&nbsp;people talk about “maximally entangled states” or “Bell states” they&nbsp;simply mean a state in which you’ve measured spin along one axis when&nbsp;you’re going to measure spin along another axis later. This can be&nbsp;talked about without reference to Bell or entanglement.</p>
<p>This thing with entanglement shows up in all kinds of popular articles by the practitioners of WC. As one example, <a href="http://qubit.damtp.cam.ac.uk/articles/intros/gmn/gmn.php">here</a>&nbsp;is a popular piece by some of the theorists (Steane and van Dam) who have demonstrated that you can use entanglement to enhance&nbsp;communication - that you can exploit the entanglement of a quantum&nbsp;state together with regular messages among observers at different&nbsp;places to get more efficient communications. The article reads in a fun&nbsp;enough way (it’s about participants at a game show who each carry their&nbsp;own little qubit into a separate cubicle and then pass messages). But&nbsp;it’s not possible. You can’t carry a qubit around because in order to&nbsp;exploit entanglement you have to have a single quantum system. This&nbsp;kind of writing comes from thinking about measurement according to the&nbsp;first way I wrote the paragraph above (measure the particle) as opposed&nbsp;to the second (measure the system).</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m being overly picky about this because it is, after all,&nbsp;just a popular article (although it works in some concepts you would&nbsp;need undergraduate physics to understand before the end). But I can&nbsp;imagine QCers saying, “well, it’s possible in principle”. But like a&nbsp;lot of “in principle” arguments I don’t buy it. I think Daniel Dennett&nbsp;dealt with this kind of argument in his brilliant “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained">Consciousness Explained</a>” when discussing the idea of a “brain in a vat” (aka the Matrix) where&nbsp;philosophers argue that you could “in principle” recreate the&nbsp;sensations of the world by stimulating the right portions of the brain.&nbsp;Dennett basically calls their bluff and accuses them of not thinking&nbsp;through the magnitude of the problem, and takes some time to spell out&nbsp;just how hugely implausible it is. Now it’s not a proof, but I think&nbsp;the same kind of thing applies to these popularizations of&nbsp;entanglement. You can “in principle” have widely separated parts of a&nbsp;single quantum state outside a hugely expensive laboratory only if you&nbsp;don’t think too hard about what the endeavour entails. In a sense, we’re&nbsp;back to the use of Unitary operators by the theorists so they don’t have to think about implementations.</p>
<p>Well, this has been more rambling than I expected, so here’s a summary of what I see as the main points.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The split between abstract theory and physical implementation in&nbsp;the structure of quantum computing is a dangerous game. It means that&nbsp;everything that quantum computing theory says needs to be taken with a&nbsp;big pinch of salt until realistic quantum computers are demonstrated.&nbsp;The widespread use of the rhetoric of entanglement and other&nbsp;ideas that focus on the non-intuitive parts of quantum mechanics&nbsp;exacerbates the problem by pulling QC theory further away from actual&nbsp;implementations.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the biggest quantum computers to date are NMR based&nbsp;demonstrates how little entanglement adds to the actual theory of QC.&nbsp;And the fact that the best alternative is the inherently exotic&nbsp;approach of ion traps is disheartening.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I’m wrong. There’s a lot of smart people working on quantum&nbsp;computing who I’m sure have thought through these issues more than I&nbsp;have, and they look like in some ways they are making progress (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing">here</a>).&nbsp;But here are two predictions that will show whether I’m right or wrong&nbsp;in a few years. One is that what constitutes a major advance will be&nbsp;redefined. The participants in a field are always enthusiastic about&nbsp;the major advances that are happening, but if we see major experimental&nbsp;advances that are phrased in terms like “enhance the understanding of&nbsp;what is necessary for quantum computation” rather than “actually&nbsp;compute something” then watch out. Second, the <a href="http://qist.lanl.gov/pdfs/rm_intro.pdf">goals</a> (PDF)&nbsp; set out by some people in the field will not be achieved.</p>
<p>Well, that’s my Canadian Thansgiving ramble. Now I’m going to plant&nbsp;some tulips, which, with a bit of luck, will appear simultaneously, as if by magic, in a coherent&nbsp;fashion next spring.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/2006/10/mistake-of-week-x-works-on-paper-but.html">recent post</a> at Shtetl Optimized discusses a <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610117">paper</a> that has some of the same criticisms as my post here, except done properly: “<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610117">Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible?</a> by M. I. Dyakonov.” Fuddy-duddies unite!</p>
