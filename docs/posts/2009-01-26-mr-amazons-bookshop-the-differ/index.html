<p>[This is the sixth instalment of Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s Bookshop. A list of all instalments is <a href="http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2008/12/mr-amazons-bookshop.html">here</a>; the previous instalment is <a href="http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2009/01/mr-amazons-bookshop-doubts-about-amazon.html">here</a>.]</p>
<p>I rocketed over to my stables at the crack of noon and cleaned up the old difference engine, or <em>differ</em> as we enthusiasts call it. My friend Mr.&nbsp;Babbage, you will recall, had told me that Mr.&nbsp;Amazon had a new trick - instead of going to Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s Bookshop, one could use a difference engine to ask him as many questions as you like. I determined to use my differ to interrogate Amazon and better understand how his intriguing operation works.</p>
<p>I had to chase out a few voles and a cat that had set up house in among the levers and pistons, and it was nearly dinner time before I fired up the bellows and the great machine began to hum. It had been some while since I last set it going and the smell of burning dust was atrocious. But finally I was able to start communing with it, and I readied my questions.</p>
<p>My first query to Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s service was a simple one, and harked back to my earliest visit. “If I tell you I like <em>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</em>, what books would you recommend?”</p>
<p>I twisted and turned the knobs until the instructions were in place, and then pulled on the master lever to set the machine to work. Steam hissed, a piercing high-pitched whine drilled at my ear drums, and for a moment I thought the whole thing was going to explode. What could be going on? I was sure I had the instructions right. I pulled harder on the lever, hoping to blow past the obstruction, but to no use. The temperature reading was creeping dangerously high and I cast about for what was wrong. Finally I caught sight of a large beetle stuck in one of the outlet valves, obstructing the flow of air. I pulled at the release lever, shutting down the process, and watched in relief as the temperature lowered.</p>
<p>Once I had cleaned out the valves, I took a swig from the sherry bottle and pulled the master lever again. “If I tell you I like <em>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</em>, what books would you recommend?” And this time, after a few scraping noises, the output pointers began to swing. A short while deciphering and I had my answer:</p>
<p><em>Absurdistan</em> by Gary Shteyngart<br>
<em>Suite Francaise</em> by Irene Nemirovsky<br>
<em>The Yiddish Policeman’s Union</em> by Michael Chabon<br>
<em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> by Junot Diaz<br>
… and a handful of others.</p>
<p>I was thrilled. I stared at the list, entranced, until a thought crawled into my awareness. Here, it said, was the link between Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s Bookshop and what I think of as a real bookshop.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s is not a bookshop. It is closer to the truth to say it is a mechanism, a differ if you like, that we each use to generate our own personal bookshop, with shelves and all, by the questions we ask of its proprietor. I had accused Mr.&nbsp;Amazon of not having shelves, but here was a set of books grouped together as I looked at <em>Special Topics…</em> Surely that is close enough to a shelf.</p>
<p>I chose one of the ten recommendations at random by the usual method of throwing a barnyard cat at the wall and counting the number of squeals it emitted. The cat squealed twice to indicate <em>The Yiddish Policeman’s Union</em> (occasionally the cat does not scream, so the counting starts at zero). and I sent up my second question to Mr.&nbsp;Amazon. “If I tell you I like <em>The Yiddish Policeman’s Union</em>, what books would you recommend?” A moment later, back came the answer:<br>
<em>The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay</em> (also by Michael Ch abon)<br>
<em>Gentlemen of the Road</em> by, you guessed it, Michael Chabon.<br>
<em>On Chesil Beach</em> by Ian McEwan<br>
<em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> by Junot Diaz<br>
… and a handful of others.</p>
<p>The shelf is longer, I muttered. Quickly I flung the cat again to select a book from the list (<em>Falling Man</em>, by Don DeLillo) and sent off the next query.</p>
<p><em>The Yiddish Policeman’s Union</em> by Michael Chabon<br>
<em>Divisadero</em> by Michael Ondaatje<br>
<em>Tree of Smoke</em> by Denis Johnson<br>
<em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> by Junot Diaz<br>
… and a handful of others.</p>
<p>This could go on indefinitely, I realised. There is no point in simply asking over and over again for recommended books. Sooner or later people stop browsing and either buy a book or leave the shop. I decided to cap the number of requests at a random number (poor cat) between 1 and 20 - 12 on this occasion - and then listed in my notebook each of the dozen books I had picked from among the recommendations. Here is that list:</p>
<p><em>Special Topics in Calamity Physics<br>
The Yiddish Policemen’s Union: A Novel (P.S.)<br>
Falling Man: A Novel<br>
Tree of Smoke: A Novel<br>
Bridge of Sighs: A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)<br>
The Story of Edgar Sawtelle: A Novel (Oprah Book Club #62)<br>
The Art of Racing in the Rain<br>
The Beach House<br>
Chasing Harry Winston: A Novel<br>
Celebutantes<br>
Remember Me?<br>
Love the One You’re With</em></p>
<p>That, I decided, looked like one visit to Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s shop. Each book selected from the list was one I had “picked up” and skimmed (at least those parts Mr.&nbsp;Amazon lets me see). Moving along shelves, picking books up that are not too far from the place you stand. There was an undeniable similarity, albeit a pale imitation of the casual, unpredictable and whimsical act of browsing in what I still thought of as a “real” bookshop.</p>
<p>I decided to simulate a second visit. I know Mr.&nbsp;Amazon would have a few recommendations waiting for me, based on my previous visits, so I cat-picked one from the list of books I had “picked up” (<em>Falling Man: A Novel</em>) and generated a second list of books:</p>
<p><em>Falling Man: A Novel<br>
Divisadero (Vintage International)<br>
The Yiddish Policemen’s Union: A Novel (P.S.)<br>
Falling Man: A Novel<br>
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao<br>
Tree of Smoke: A Novel<br>
Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA<br>
The Post-American World<br>
The Second World: Empires and Influence in the New Global Order<br>
The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East<br>
The Return of History and the End of Dreams<br>
Dangerous Nation: America’s Place in the World, from it’s Earliest Days to the Dawn of the 20th Century<br>
Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East: 1776 to the Present<br>
Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East<br>
The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977<br>
Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East</em><br>
<em>The Arab-Israeli Wars: War and Peace in the Middle East</em></p>
<p>Some books, I noticed, were appearing again and again. Who on earth, I wondered, is this <em>Oscar Wao</em> whose brief wondrous life is appearing in all the lists I generate? And what is this <em>Falling Man</em>? I had heard of neither, yet Mr.&nbsp;Amazon seemed to be pushing them at me insistently. And how had I got from a literary mystery to what looked like nonfiction books about the near Orient? There was so much to think about in these lists that I copied the second list into my notebook and headed to my library to think, telling Google to bring me some smoked kippers, Turkish coffee, and the latest copy of the <em>Literary Review</em>. He bowed obsequiously, but not quickly enough to hide the supercilious smirk he sometimes gives, as if he knows not only what problems I seek to solve but the answers too. But this quest was becoming my own, and I did not want his help.</p>
<p>It was Jennie the one-legged housekeeper who climbed the worn stone steps of the western wing to my library in the turret, bringing the kippers, a wet copy of the <em>Literary Review</em>, and a half-empty cup of luke-warm coffee. It is most inconvenient that she is crippled and I shall have to do something about it - perhaps reassign her to the kitchen where she does not have to move about so much? But this is not the time to indulge myself in such sentimental nonsense, I told myself. My warm heart and generous nature is so well known locally that I fear they are often taken advantage of. I must make myself of sterner stuff. So I dismissed Jennie and turned to the <em>Review</em>.</p>
<p>First, those two books. It turns out they were not so obscure as I thought. <em>Falling Man</em> is written by that impetuous youngster Don DeLillo, author of <em>Underworld</em>. And <em>Oscar Wao</em> won something called a Pulitzer Prize, that is apparently worthy of note in the provinces. Amazon, I was slightly chuffed to realise, was showing me books that were new to me, but - despite what I am often told is my encyclopedic knowledge - far from obscure. I could probably pick up either of those volumes at Words Worth or at Heather’s Big House O’Books.</p>
<p>And how did we get from Special Topics to The Arab Israeli Wars? Via <em>The Falling Man</em>, it seems. That book is a literary novel (and so linked to Special Topics) and yet is concerned with terrorism, and so leads us into other books about warfare and terrorism. Not too far-fetched, I thought, and yet ingenious.</p>
<p>As I stretched in front of the library fire, the warmth and my exhertions combined to induce a sluggish drowsiness. I drifted in and out of a doze, my mind filled with pictures of endless lists of books, on topics leaping from terrorism to gourmet cooking to accounting in a few bounds. How could I impose some kind of order on this profligacy? What can one learn from this spewing of titles? How does Mr.&nbsp;Amazon impose order? He must, I was convinced, have some mechanism for governing the labours of those poor, enslaved mole-people deep in his basement-factories.</p>
<p>Just before my dozing turned to sleep, I remembered one nugget of information that had come back along with the title in response to my requests - the SalesRank. This, I knew, is Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s seller list. But unlike a real best seller list, it does not stop at a mere ten or so items. Instead, as seems typical of Mr.&nbsp;Amazon’s industrious nature, it goes on and on into the hundreds, the thousands, the hundreds of thousands, each book with its rank. That, I decided, would be the starting point for my next investigation.</p>
