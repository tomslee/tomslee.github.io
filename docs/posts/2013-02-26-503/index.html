<p>_Finishing up what I said I’d finish a couple of months ago, this is a shorter version of a paper on “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2116471">Identity, Institutions, and Uprisings</a>” with&nbsp;__less mathematics, no references (see the link above) and more opinionating.&nbsp;__Also, a longer version of what I’m going to say at <a href="http://www.theorizingtheweb.org/2013/">Theorizing the Web 2013</a> in&nbsp;__a few days._</p>
<p>There is a theoretical side to the “Facebook Revolution” debate about the role&nbsp;of digital technologies in the 2011 “Arab Spring” uprisings, and it boils down&nbsp;to two ways of looking at things: the micro and the macro. On the one hand, we&nbsp;have the rational choice, agent-based approach and on the other we have more&nbsp;traditional sociological approaches based on larger-scale social structures.</p>
If you look at some of the key characteristics of the uprisings, it looks like&nbsp;a win for the micro side.

<p>The single most dramatic thing about the “Arab Spring” uprisings was their&nbsp;unexpected suddenness. They fit the “information cascade” models developed by&nbsp;Timur Kuran, Suzanne Lohmann and others to describe the equally dramatic and&nbsp;sudden 1989 uprisings in Eastern Europe. Nothing on the “macro” side matches&nbsp;the elegant explanation of sudden, discontinuous change given by the&nbsp;micro-theorists.</p>
<p>Related to this suddenness is the lack of a strong opposition movement before&nbsp;the uprising. It’s not that there was <em>no</em> opposition, but there was nothing&nbsp;of the strength to indicate a coming crisis. The cascade theories have no&nbsp;need, or even place, for organizations or movements: these are population&nbsp;dynamics models, with no structure bigger than the networked individual.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the leading sociological theories deal with movements,&nbsp;organizations, and resource mobilization. Score two to the micro-theorists.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the role of digital technologies, which segues naturally to&nbsp;network models of society. Talk of information technologies leads equally&nbsp;naturally to a focus on information diffusion across networks, in which&nbsp;increased connectivity lowering barriers to collaboration, discussion, and&nbsp;information sharing. And the macro-theorists again seem to have little on&nbsp;their side to cope with these kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>It looks like a shut-out win for the micro-theorists; the language of networks&nbsp;and information replaces the language of social movements and repertoires of&nbsp;performance, and with that comes the inevitable idea that with a new kind of&nbsp;theory we are we seeing a new kind of uprising, in which self-organizing&nbsp;networks based on digital technologies take centre stage…</p>
<p>But you will have realized by now that this is a setup for me to argue that&nbsp;there’s another way of looking at these events, so let’s get to it.</p>
<p>The key success of micro-level theory is the explanation of cascades, which is&nbsp;a natural consequence of any model that has multiple equilibria. Just because&nbsp;of that success, we don’t need to go whole hog and take on board the ideas of&nbsp;information-driven and network-sustained change. I want to argue that we can&nbsp;take the concepts that sociological research has shown to be important, and&nbsp;move them into the realm of rational choice models. And when we do, we not&nbsp;only get population dynamics and cascades, but we also get explanations for&nbsp;several other aspects of dissent and uprisings that networks and&nbsp;information-based theories can’t deliver.</p>
<p>Is there a downside? Of course there is. Behind the scenes, it’s often the&nbsp;case that rational choice theorists like long equations while sociologists&nbsp;love long words. Rational choice theorists see the sociologists’ concepts as&nbsp;fuzzy, while the sociologists see the incentives of rational choice models as&nbsp;simplistic. What I have to offer demands <em>both</em> long equations <em>and</em> long&nbsp;words, and is open to being criticism for being simultaneously simplistic and&nbsp;fuzzy. Ah well.</p>

<section id="facebook-as-a-free-space" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facebook-as-a-free-space">Facebook as a “free space”</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a question. Zeynep Tufekci is a sociologist who was in Egypt&nbsp;right after the January 2011 uprisings, interviewing participants. Here’s what&nbsp;she says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
When I was in post-Mubarak Cairo, my hosts kept pointing in amazement to&nbsp;various street corners where fierce political discussions were being held and&nbsp;often whispered, before remembering they could now speak up and adjusting&nbsp;their voice, “You never saw this. Nobody ever discussed politics openly,&nbsp;ever.” Then they would pause and add, “Well, except online, of course. We all&nbsp;discussed politics online.”
</blockquote>
<p>So the question is that final sentence. Why is it that, prior to the&nbsp;revolution, people could discuss politics online but not elsewhere? What made&nbsp;“online” a venue where those discussions could take place? It’s not just ease&nbsp;of communication, because if you want to communicate you can stand on a busy&nbsp;street corner – as people were doing when Tufekci visited.</p>
<p>The key thing is that communication online was, for some reason, safe, while&nbsp;communication on the street was not. It’s not just that communication among&nbsp;like-minded people was possible, but that the “online” spaces were a venue&nbsp;where such communication did not have the same &nbsp;consequences. Somehow, the&nbsp;speech was hidden from those in power. It was a trusted environment.</p>
<p>Now while the logic of networks is a good way to explain easy communication,&nbsp;it doesn’t lend itself to discussions of trust. Fortunately sociologists have&nbsp;long been aware of the importance of these “free spaces” in which dissenting&nbsp;voices can communicate. Here are Francesca Polletta and James Jasper in a 2001&nbsp;paper:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
Concepts of “submerged networks”, “halfway houses”, “free spaces”, “havens”,&nbsp;“sequestered social sites”, and “abeyance structures” describe institutions&nbsp;removed from the physical and ideological control of those in power, for&nbsp;example the black church before the civil rights movement and literary circles&nbsp;in communist Eastern Europe. Such institutions… represent a “free space” in&nbsp;which people can develop counterhegemonic ideas and oppositional identities.
</blockquote>
<p>So these notions of “free spaces” have been around for some time and surely&nbsp;fit something about the way that online political discussion worked in Egypt.&nbsp;Free spaces are institutions (in a broad sense of the term) that are not&nbsp;outlawed, but which appeal to outsiders of society rather than to those who&nbsp;identify with the powers-that-be. They manage to be transparent to their members&nbsp;while being opaque to officialdom.</p>
More generally, following Charles Tilly and Sidney Tarrow, we can think of&nbsp;institutions in &nbsp;authoritarian states as being of three kinds.

<ul>
<li><p><em>Prescribed institutions</em> are the mainstream and establishment institutions&nbsp;of society. They may include the education system, organizations like the&nbsp;army, and also things like national celebrations. Some of these institutions&nbsp;include people of all levels of status, while some are restricted to&nbsp;high-status individuals and families.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tolerated institutions</em> are legal, but their membership is limited to&nbsp;lower-status individuals. In some countries these would include religious&nbsp;institutions associated with minority groups, perhaps some artistic and&nbsp;cultural institutions, and workplace organizations in countries where they&nbsp;can exist outside official control. These are the venues that, according to&nbsp;Polletta and Jasper, can provide spaces for dissent. Obviously there is a&nbsp;wide range of what institutions are tolerated and what are forbidden. North&nbsp;Korea has a lot fewer “tolerated” institutions than 1980 Poland.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Forbidden institutions</em> are those that are not permitted in authoritarian&nbsp;societies. Opposition political parties, independent unions, that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But how do these institutions become “removed from the physical and&nbsp;ideological control of those in power”? The answer lies in what Polletta &amp;&nbsp;Jasper call “collective identity”. Tolerated institutions –whether&nbsp;subcultures, groups, or whatever – build up their own practices to establish&nbsp;autonomy.</p>
<p>Collective identity is “an individual’s cognitive, moral, and emotional&nbsp;connection with a broader community, category, practice, or institution.” It&nbsp;gets expressed in “cultural materials—names, narratives, symbols, verbal&nbsp;styles, rituals, clothing, and so on.” And these expressions provide boundary-setting rituals and institutions that separate challengers from those&nbsp;in power, and so can strengthen internal solidarity.</p>
<p>Examples of “free spaces” in authoritarian societies abound. In his book&nbsp;<em>Exit-Voice Dynamics and the Collapse of East Germany</em>, Steven Pfaff&nbsp;highlights the importance of some very narrow institutions that he calls&nbsp;“Niche society”. These are “pockets of private life, around home, car and&nbsp;allotment” where people could voice their disenchantment and cynicism. A&nbsp;broader form of dissent took place in institutions of youth culture: despite&nbsp;party efforts to establish bands and music venues for German youth, many&nbsp;sought out more alternative forms of music, and clashes took place &nbsp;between&nbsp;fans and police at concerts. Music events are not, at least publicly,&nbsp;political events and so while the events might not be forbidden, you would not&nbsp;find party supporters taking part. Finally, Pfaff notes that “Dissent could&nbsp;only take place in gaps in the system of social control that dissidents could&nbsp;exploit. In the GDR this principally meant the churches.” Again, churches are&nbsp;an example of an institution that was legal, but which naturally separated society’s outsiders from those in power.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connecting-identity-to-rational-choice">Connecting Identity to Rational Choice?</h2>
<p>So now we seem to have two separate sets of ideas. On the one hand we have a&nbsp;theory of uprisings that makes no use of sociological concepts. On the other&nbsp;hand, to explain pre-uprising dissent we need to look at sociological ideas&nbsp;such as institutions and identity. Obviously there is a bridge that must be&nbsp;built if we are to connect these seemingly separate theoretical islands. Can&nbsp;the gap be bridged? Well yes it can, thanks to the “identity economics” work&nbsp;of George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, who&nbsp;argue that identity provides a key motivation for many&nbsp;social situations. They &nbsp;take the concept of identity seriously, and&nbsp;simplify it to fit it into a tractable micro-level model.&nbsp;Identity, they say, has three parts to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First is a set of social&nbsp;categories: for us, those categories are “government supporter” or “opponent”.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, each of these identities has a set of attributes associated with it.&nbsp;These vary from society to society. Economic status is one, religious&nbsp;or ethnic or gender identities are others.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, each identity has a set of norms of&nbsp;behavior: in this case we simplify the options to “conform” to society’s expectations or “dissent”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals then have two choices to make. First, they need to adopt an&nbsp;identity: _G_overnment or _O_pposition? Next, if they are oppositional they&nbsp;need to decide whether to engage in active dissent or to conform to official&nbsp;expectations. If we arrange the population according to status, then those at&nbsp;the lower status choose <em>O</em> (<em>O</em>&nbsp;has a higher utility), and people with higher&nbsp;status choose <em>G</em>. Here is a graph that shows a case where the switchover&nbsp;appears at the mid-point.</p>
<p>[caption id=“attachment_504” align=“aligncenter” width=“450”][<img src="http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-utility-300x225.png" class="img-fluid" alt="b-utility">](http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-utility.png) Utility and identity in an authoritarian society[/caption]</p>
<p>In some times and places, no one gives a hoot which identity you adopt, while&nbsp;at other times and places it can be a matter of life or death. I’ll call this&nbsp;scaling of the difference between <em>O</em> and <em>G</em> the <em>identity polarization</em> of&nbsp;society, and we’ll be needing this concept a lot.</p>
<p>Identity is one of the two things we need to explain “free spaces” but before&nbsp;we go to the other, let’s take a short detour. One of the key successes of&nbsp;information-driven rational choice models was the fact that they yield&nbsp;cascades. Can our identity-driven model also give cascades? Funny you should ask…</p>
</section>
<section id="identity-cascades" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identity-cascades">Identity Cascades</h2>
<p>Here is a cascade.</p>
<p>[caption id=“attachment_505” align=“aligncenter” width=“450”][<img src="http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-cascade-300x225.png" class="img-fluid" alt="b-cascade">](http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-cascade.png) A cascade. The yellow line and the yellow dot are equilibria of the model.[/caption]</p>
<p>If you want to know the gory details, including what the “hegemony” label on&nbsp;the x axis means, you have to go and read the paper. But see that there are&nbsp;two equilibria here. One is a stable authoritarian state, with zero activity&nbsp;(the yellow line at the right) and a high government hegemony. The other is a&nbsp;state in crisis, with a high level of dissent (the yellow dot where the lines&nbsp;cross). And a small change in society can lead to a sudden &nbsp;discontinuous&nbsp;switch from one to the other: a <em>cascade</em>.</p>
<p>To generate multiple equilibria you need some form of externality: some way in&nbsp;which one person’s actions influence those around them. This model generates&nbsp;cascades by asserting that active dissent increases the identity polarization&nbsp;of society: <em>the more active dissent there is, the more it matters which side you are on</em>. It’s not so much an information cascade as an <em>identity cascade</em>.</p>
<p>Although this is a rational choice model, it does not invoke networks, and&nbsp;information is not central to the argument. In most cascade models the cascade&nbsp;is generated by two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>active dissent reveals information, about the state of the society or about&nbsp;the beliefs of other people. This is the “preference falsification”&nbsp;argument.</p></li>
<li><p>there is safety in numbers: the more people protesting, the safer it is to&nbsp;protest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve criticized these ideas <a href="http://tomslee.net/2012/12/what-cascade-theories-leave-out.html">here</a>, but is there any evidence to suggest that&nbsp;identity does get polarized as a result of dissent? Anecdotally, there is.&nbsp;Here is a Marxist radical speaking about Paris, 1968:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
I was completely surprised by 1968… I had an idea of the revolutionary&nbsp;process and it was nothing like this. I saw students building barricades,&nbsp;but these were people who knew nothing of revolution. They&nbsp;were not even political. There was no organisation, no planning.
</blockquote>
<p>In the lead-up to 1968, French students were not revolutionaries who had&nbsp;falsified their true preferences in order to conform to society’s&nbsp;expectations. What happened was that during the riots, identity (status quo or&nbsp;radical?) became a central issue, and individuals had to decide “which side&nbsp;are you on?”, and many students switched their identities from mildly&nbsp;status-quo to enthusiastic barricade-builder.</p>
<p>A switch in identity happens when people are pulled along by those around&nbsp;them. As Dennis Chong (1991) writes of the US Civil Rights movement:&nbsp;“friendship and familial, religious, and professional relationships create an&nbsp;array of ongoing exchanges, obligations and expectations that individual.”</p>
<p>In his book on the fall of the GDR, Steven Pfaff repeatedly invokes the&nbsp;“preference falsification” model, but he often steps outside it too. In fact,&nbsp;my biased reading of it is that he sometimes resorts to the preference&nbsp;falsification model because of a lack of alternatives, not because the&nbsp;evidence pulls him that way. But when he writes that “By 1989 official&nbsp;socialist ideology, along with its clear articulation of the nature of&nbsp;injustice, had become a threat to the system it was meant to legitimate” he is&nbsp;talking about a crisis of identity. The crisis served to “focus diffuse&nbsp;grievances”, uniting “a host of disparate concerns into ‘moral anger”’. This&nbsp;is the crystallization of identities into the two polar choices:”Which side&nbsp;are you on?”</p>
<p>The “identity cascade” model also makes a closer connection between dynamics&nbsp;and the efforts of protesters. I’ll return to this later, but one of the&nbsp;things that protesters do in uprisings is lay claim to the symbols of&nbsp;national identity. Whether it’s Gandhi’s Salt March or GDR protesters&nbsp;choosing the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country, struggles over&nbsp;the meaning of identity become central at times of crisis. If information&nbsp;revelation was all that were needed, there would be no role for the displays&nbsp;of “worthiness, unity, numbers and commitment” that characterize political&nbsp;protest. An identity-driven approach makes this link clear, within a&nbsp;rational choice framework.</p>
<p>(Another nice thing is that within the identity cascade model there is a&nbsp;natural categorization of the kind of events that can precipitate a cascade. A&nbsp;shock to the norms associated with opposition, a change in socio-economic&nbsp;conditions that places more people into the “outsider” category, or a change&nbsp;in state policy (perestroika) all emerge as triggers for cascades. See the&nbsp;paper for more.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="free-spaces-and-screening">Free Spaces and Screening</h2>
<p>With that diversion over, let’s return to the topic of free spaces. How do we&nbsp;get from the language of Polletta and Jasper to the world of rational choice?&nbsp;There is a natural correspondence in the concept of <em>screening</em>: a mechanism&nbsp;that imposes differential costs for two different groups, so that (in a&nbsp;“separating” equilibrium) one group finds it worthwhile to pay the cost, while&nbsp;the other does not. Here, the identity-driven costs of being a member of&nbsp;“tolerated” institution screens out those with the status quo (<em>G</em>) identity.</p>
<p>Just as Akerlof and Kranton simplified identity so that it could be squeezed&nbsp;into a rational choice picture, so we have to simplify the idea of an&nbsp;institution. Henceforth, then, an institution <em>I</em> is characterized by three&nbsp;things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Status (x):</em> This is the natural membership of the institution. We can say&nbsp;that the <em>identity of the institution</em> is the optimal&nbsp;identity of an individual with status <em>x</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Breadth (δ):</em> Individuals with status in [x - δ, x +&nbsp;δ] are members of <em>I</em>. The “niche society” institutions of the GDR&nbsp;have a very narrow breadth, while events such as national celebrations&nbsp;include all of society.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Membership discrimination (m):</em> Some institutions do not discriminate&nbsp;between the two identities, but some do. A discriminating institution&nbsp;demands a cost of membership for individuals whose identity differs from&nbsp;the identity of the institution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With this idea, you can build a model in which there is a range of&nbsp;institutions that even a strong state will not monitor, because the cost of&nbsp;monitoring is greater than the benefit in terms of dissent that is quieted.&nbsp;These institutions provide the free space for dissent to persist even under&nbsp;conditions of strong government.</p>
<p>Here are some screening institutions</p>
<p>[caption id=“attachment_506” align=“aligncenter” width=“450”][<img src="http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-screening-institutions-300x225.png" class="img-fluid" alt="b-screening-institutions">](http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-screening-institutions.png) Screening institutions.[/caption]</p>
<p>The screening institutions are those inside the lozenge shapes. Along the x&nbsp;axis is the status, so all these institutions are “tolerated” in that they&nbsp;are entirely within the “outsider” low-status zone. The broader the reach of&nbsp;the institution (that’s the “<em>δ</em>” in the graph) the less scope there is for&nbsp;these institutions. Finally, and it’s beyond what I can explain in this part,&nbsp;there is a limit to the size of the “public sphere” that also limits the&nbsp;available institutions.</p>
<p>So what this shows is that the economic concept of screening brings to the&nbsp;identity-driven rational choice model the idea of free spaces, well&nbsp;established within the sociological literature. To go back to the beginning&nbsp;of this essay, the existence of such spaces is something that the network&nbsp;models, with their focus on costs of communication, don’t seem well equipped&nbsp;to describe. So now we have a single theory that covers both uprisings and&nbsp;pre-revolutionary dissent, instead of two (one micro, one macro).&nbsp;We can now see that the “free spaces” of online dissent are&nbsp;similar to, and exist for the same reasons as, other free spaces that have&nbsp;existed in the past. Even in Egypt, the role of the Ultras football fans can&nbsp;fit within this model, the football stadium terraces providing a “tolerated”&nbsp;institution within which dissent could be expressed. The model also argues&nbsp;that the key facet of online spaces is not their technological nature, but the&nbsp;fact that they were adopted by, and associated with, the broadly&nbsp;anti-establishment demographic of urban youth. Navigating the discussion&nbsp;spaces of the online world is easy if you have friends who are taking part:&nbsp;not so easy if you are a government official trying to pose as a&nbsp;disenfranchised youth. The technology of social media is <em>epiphenomenal</em>.&nbsp;In broad strokes, this is an argument I made some time&nbsp;ago <a href="http://tomslee.net/2011/02/more-egypt-more-facebook.html">here</a>: it’s only taken two years for me to work it out properly.</p>
<p>Institutions and Challenges</p>
<p>The final case to look at is when a social movement challenges a weak government. The goal is to put the government in a “dictator’s dilemma”. The idea that clamping down on dissent has the possibility of drawing attention to it, and perhaps fanning the flames, is an old one. Here is a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
[S]ometimes repression inspires more mobilization; and sometimes it effectively quashes movements or pushes them underground. Sometimes repressive forces are&nbsp;successful in characterizing protesters as legitimate targets of repression, and other times they deligitimize the State and increase the legitimacy of the social movements. – Cristina Flesher Fominaya and Lesley Wood
</blockquote>
<p>Or, going back a little further:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
Censorship makes every banned text, bad or good, into an extraordinary text. – Karl Marx
</blockquote>
<p>The contrasting fortunes of the GDR protests and the Tienanmen Square&nbsp;protests in 1989 are the best known example of this dual possibility.</p>
<p>When they believe the time is right, social movements may actively seek to&nbsp;provoke a crisis (contrary to the “safety in numbers” cost minimization&nbsp;that the information cascade theorists tend to favour). Famously, here is&nbsp;Gandhi:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
The function of a civil resistance is to provoke response and we will continue&nbsp;to provoke until they respond or change the law. – M. K. Gandhi
</blockquote>
<p>We can bring this idea of provocation into a micro model if we bring in a&nbsp;unitary social movement and invoke an interdependency between identity&nbsp;polarization and government coercion. Again, the mathematics is in the paper.</p>
<p>The question we ask is “if you were an organized opposition, what institution would you target, so that a clampdown&nbsp;would cause polarization?” The idea is that clampdown on a mainstream&nbsp;institution would be more likely to polarize society, by disturbing even the&nbsp;government’s own supporters, than clamping down on an “outsider” institution.&nbsp;Again, the opposition has to make a payment to appropriate a mainstream&nbsp;institution, because of membership selectivity. They have to pass with the identity of a status quo supporter. They need&nbsp;to appeal to mainstream sensibilities and to establish legitimacy. Under the&nbsp;right circumstances, an opposition will pay the cost of provocation, because&nbsp;they anticipate that a government response will weaken, not strengthen, the&nbsp;government’s level of control. Here is a figure showing a set of institutions that can be used by an&nbsp;opposition to provoke a crisis.</p>
<p>[caption id=“attachment_507” align=“aligncenter” width=“450”][<img src="http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-opp-provocative-institutions-300x225.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Institutions that may provoke a crisis">](http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/b-opp-provocative-institutions.png) Institutions that may provoke a crisis[/caption]</p>
<p>The institutions that may provoke a crisis are those within the central closed&nbsp;shape, bounded clockwise by light blue (on top), green, red, and purple.&nbsp;Some of these institutions are “tolerated” institutions to the left of the&nbsp;x* line, with oppositional identities; for these institutions there is no&nbsp;membership cost to be paid by the opposition. Others are “prescribed”&nbsp;institutions that have a mainstream identity. The opposition must pay the&nbsp;price of appropriating these institutions: participating in them in such a&nbsp;way as to provoke the government.</p>
<p>An example of this behaviour comes again from the GDR uprisings of 1989, as&nbsp;described by Steven Pfaff. The opposition chose the celebrations of the GDR’s&nbsp;fortieth anniversary – a mainstream institution – in which to provoke a&nbsp;response. The government did respond, but “its brutal attacks on peaceful&nbsp;protesters during the fortieth anniversary … probably activated what might&nbsp;have otherwise remained despairing, but inert, citizens.”</p>
<p>The opposition made explicit attempts to portray themselves as mainstream&nbsp;Germans, adopting the simple slogan of “Wir sind das volk” (“We are the&nbsp;people”).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
“Wir sind das volk” [was] a thin claim, but an uncomplicated “us versus them” message, a claim to political identity that could bridge lines of class, education, neighborhood, and so on. – Steven Pfaff
</blockquote>
<p>In previous times, other uprisings have explicitly chosen mainstream or&nbsp;sometimes tolerated institutions as a means of provocation. Gandhi’s use of&nbsp;the Salt March, the Chinese students’ use of the death of Hu Yaobang and&nbsp;Tienanmen Square, the Egyptian protesters appropriation of National Police Day and&nbsp;Tahrir Square all follow this pattern.</p>
<p>There are claims that digital technologies at times of crisis can act in this&nbsp;manner. Ethan Zuckerman has popularized the idea as a “Cute Cat” theory: that&nbsp;mainstream institutions provide a venue for dissent that cannot be shut down&nbsp;without polarizing society. The theory here provides at best limited and&nbsp;conditional support for the idea. Digital technologies were not used as a&nbsp;mechanism of provocation, but played a supporting role. The “cute cat” idea has credence only if the government is not able to silence dissent in a more&nbsp;selective manner than shutting down the entire internet or phone service&nbsp;within the country.</p>
<p>My favourite example is the French “Banquet Campaign” of 1848. Republicans&nbsp;were campaigning for universal male suffrage against an intransigent&nbsp;government that had banned political meetings. Faced with the problem of&nbsp;organizing an opposition in such an environment, they organized banquets. On&nbsp;the 18th of July in Mâcon, Burgundy, five hundred tables were set up for three&nbsp;thousand guests with stands for three thousand more, ostensibly as a&nbsp;celebration of local literary star Alphonse de Lamartine. Lamartine was not&nbsp;just a literary star though, he was also a well-known republican, and the&nbsp;authorities knew that the banquet was a cover for political agitation. But the&nbsp;authorities judged that interfering with the banquets would inflame the&nbsp;situation rather than succeed in suppressing the protest, and so let the&nbsp;banquet proceed. With the success of the Mâcon banquet, the “Campagne des&nbsp;banquets” was launched, and banquets were held around the country.&nbsp;This is the high wire act that governments and opposition walk at times of&nbsp;crisis – when to push ahead, when to hold back, and what tactics may be&nbsp;effective – and is the kind of dance that social movement studies have helped&nbsp;to elucidate. The campaign continued until February of the next year, when the&nbsp;government decided it had no choice but to escalate. The banquets were&nbsp;outlawed, a hastily organized protest brought people into the streets of Paris&nbsp;on February 22, a confrontation between the Municipal Guard and the marchers&nbsp;spilled over into riots, everything got out of hand, and the King fled Paris.&nbsp;Within a few weeks governments were toppled in Milan, Venice, Naples, Palermo,&nbsp;Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Berlin.&nbsp;I like to think that the graph above captures a little of that drama.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>What I’ve tried to do here is follow the Akerlof &amp; Kranton example of taking&nbsp;the rich sociological concepts of identity seriously, and used it to construct&nbsp;a rational choice model of uprisings that complements, rather than competes&nbsp;with, sociological models. I’ve added some dynamics to the approach, and&nbsp;brought in a modelling of institutions to build on the notion of collective&nbsp;identity as a motivating force for protest.</p>
<p>The results are that the theory recovers the key facet of other rational&nbsp;choice models of uprisings, which is cascades, but with a different&nbsp;interpretation. Here it is “identity cascades” rather than “information&nbsp;cascades” that drive the sudden change.&nbsp;Beyond cascades, the theory shows how screening provides a mechanism for the&nbsp;existence of “free space” institutions in which dissent can be sustained,&nbsp;even in authoritarian regimes. Finally, it shows how an organized opposition&nbsp;may appropriate mainstream institutions with the explicit intent of&nbsp;provoking a crisis, putting the government in a “dictator’s dilemma” in which&nbsp;neither responding nor failing to respond is a good option.</p>
